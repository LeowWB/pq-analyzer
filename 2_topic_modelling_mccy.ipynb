       "      <td>Mdm Chair, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy intensity − the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) − improved by 1.8% in 2015. This surpassed the 1.5% gain seen in 2014, and triples the annual rate of 0.6% seen in the previous decade, according to IEA Energy Efficiency Market Report for 2016. But the report added that and I quote: \"However, global progress on energy intensity is still too slow, falling short of putting the world onto a sustainable pathway toward a decarbonised energy system. IEA analysis shows that annual energy intensity improvements need to rise immediately to at least 2.6% in a trajectory consistent with our climate goals.\" I would like to ask the Minister how is our performance in industrial energy efficiency efforts compared with other countries? What is the feedback from industries on the obstacles they are facing and what can the Ministry do to address these concerns? How are we to fulfil our commitment to the Paris Agreement? Are there any new plans to improve on our industrial energy efficiency? Our city state has done well in managing the air quality from vehicle emission. Unlike the days before year 2000, certainly we hardly see smoky vehicles on our roads, except some from across the causeway. Even the public can report to NEA if they see any smoky vehicles on our road. NEA requires periodic checks for buses and diesel vehicles and we strive to reduce domestic emissions to meet the 2020 air quality targets benchmarked against WHO standards. We have been successful and there are lessons to be learnt from what is happening in China, India and France where smoke from vehicle emission had created havoc on the ambient air quality. The toll can be very serious as we can see how the haze impacted the health of the people. WHO has pointed out that air pollution pose one of the biggest environmental health risks, especially for heart diseases. Can the Minister update the House on what is the strategy to achieve these targets and what has been done so far to improve the air quality in Singapore? Diesel vehicles are found to be the major culprit in polluting the air. In December 2016, four of the world's largest and most polluted cities have decided to ban diesel cars and trucks from their streets by 2025. Diesel engines emit particulates into the air at ground level, as well as emit nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides can help form ground-level ozone, which can lead to breathing difficulties for those suffering from respiratory problems. According to WHO, seven million deaths every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. At the last COS debate, we were told that a study on diesel vehicles would be undertaken by SUTD. I understand that it has recently submitted a report on alternative technologies to the Ministry. Can the Minister share with the House the outcome of this study? What next after this? There are some older commercial vehicles retained by their owners which do not meet current day emission standards. What are the Ministry's plans to address these old commercial vehicles? Will the ETS be extended? Apart from this, what are plans to curb emission from petrol cars and motorcycles? Next, I would like to briefly point out that there is much that can be done to improve the waste collection system. Frequently, we can see cleaners manually hauling refuse to the bin centres from the chutes at the HDB blocks. This gives rise to complaints from residents about the odour and the spread of pests when this exercise is not done properly. Are there any plans for the Ministry to improve on this waste disposal by cleaners? I note that the cost of water supply has risen over the years and the Government is raising prices by 30% in two phases from this July. I think what we need to do is to share with Singaporeans what the Government is doing to meet future demand and make our country resilient against any supply disruption especially in the current uncertain weather conditions? This would I feel at least make the people understand and appreciate the big picture behind the price increase. While on climate change, I would like to ask the Minister what are PUB's plans to cope with the unpredictable and intense rainfall that we may encounter in this age of weather turbulence. I know there were drainage works carried out to alleviate flooding, but as the past months have shown, there are many pockets in our midst where more work is required. I hope the Minister can update the House on the work done so far on the Stamford Diversion Canal, Stamford Detention Tank, and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. Has any of these been completed, and if so how have they helped to prevent flooding in key areas? On PUB, I would like to ask if the Minister can update us on the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme which was launched a decade ago. Where are we now? What more can we expect of ABC Waters for this financial year? Recently, the NEA has designated smoking areas in busy downtown Orchard Road. I do not know if this is after taking a cue from Nee Soon South, where we have successfully put up 42 Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) and eight more in progress; a total of 50 DSPs. I hope the Orchard Road experience is positive. May I ask what plans are there to further expand this to other parts of Singapore, and protect the public from inhaling second-hand cigarette smoke?</td>\n",

I thank everyone who has spoken about the need to protect our resources for future generations. Singapore is not alone. Many other countries are paying closer attention to the environment, even as they grow their economies. We have a plan called the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB). This plan brings together all that we are doing, in pursuit of a Liveable and Endearing Home, a Vibrant and Sustainable City, and an Active and Gracious Community. I am glad to say that we have made progress over the course of 2016, and remain on track to meet the SSB targets progressively by 2030. A strong commitment to sustainability remains critical as we build our future economy. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms K Thanaletchimi have highlighted, it will take not only Government support but also the collective effort of every individual to realise this SSB vision. That is why we launched the Sustainable Singapore Movement in July last year to galvanise the community to action. Climate change. While we stand on solid footing, the road ahead is uncertain. A major concern for us is climate change, a far-reaching threat that we can already see and feel today. Our Meteorological Service recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1929, when we started keeping temperature records. In recent years, our water managers, too, have had a foretaste of the looming challenge of coping with extended dry spells on the one hand and higher intensity rainfall on the other. Singapore has to plan ahead to deal with climate change impacts. We will not only need to protect our buildings, coasts and infrastructure, but also foster greater awareness, so that we are a resilient people. As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore is committed to fulfilling our pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Both households and industry play a role in this, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh has noted. Industry, however, contributes the lion\\'s share − 60% − of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions. We, therefore, need to focus our efforts here. The upcoming carbon tax to be imposed on large emitters, as announced by the Minister for Finance, will help send the right price signal to industries to reduce their emissions when and where it makes the most business sense. The carbon tax, however, is not a panacea for achieving our 2030 emissions pledge. We will need other measures to complement the tax. That is why we introduced the Energy Conservation Act (ECA) in 2013, to put in place measures, such as mandatory energy management, and encourage companies to enhance their energy efficiency. I am pleased to report that we have made progress on this front since then. Let me give an example. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to show some slides please. Murata Electronics Singapore, which manufactures electronic components, is becoming an early adopter of efficient motors. Murata is replacing 50 motors with higher efficiency ones. This will save Murata some 160 MWh of electricity each year. These annual savings of $21,000 in energy costs will last throughout the 15-year lifespan of the motors. Murata is a good example of how industrial energy efficiency measures can benefit the environment as well as the company\\'s bottom line, but, for the industry sector as a whole, there is clearly more to be done. Data collected shows that our companies achieved an annual energy efficiency improvement rate of 0.6% in 2015, a slight improvement over 0.4% in 2014. This is still low. To meet our 2030 pledge, we need to work towards the 1% to 2% improvement rates achieved by leading countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands. On a positive note, companies that I spoke to at a recent consultation session recognised the importance of improving their energy efficiency. They, however, mentioned that they faced operational and capability constraints. Some also asked for best practices and useful data to be shared with them. We are studying their feedback and, for a start, we will amend the Energy Conservation Act to introduce a new set of initiatives to help companies improve their energy efficiency. First, all ECA-registered companies will now be required to implement structured energy management systems and conduct regular energy efficiency opportunity assessments. Second, companies expanding their facilities will need to factor energy efficiency into their designs upfront, as well as measure and report energy usage for key energy-consuming systems. Third, NEA\\'s data shows that a substantial proportion of common industrial equipment is inefficient. Hence, Minimum Energy Performance Standards will be introduced, first, for motors, and then other systems and equipment progressively. These practices are in line with that of leading jurisdictions and will help companies to adopt more efficient equipment, conserve energy and enjoy life cycle cost savings. To pave the way for a robust carbon tax regime, we need to have a sound Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. The ECA will thus be amended to require larger industrial emitters to improve the quality of measurement and reporting processes for their greenhouse gas emissions. This will help companies to better understand and manage their emissions. My Ministry will continue to work closely with the NCCS and MTI to consult the affected companies on how to best achieve this. We have also received feedback on the need to improve the current incentive schemes. NEA will be consolidating their existing energy efficiency incentive schemes into a single fund called the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F). NEA will redesign the E2F to better support companies to identify and undertake energy efficiency retrofits. We will, especially help our SMEs by co-funding up to 30% of their investments in energy efficient technologies. Further details will be released by NEA. We need a sustainable way to grow our economy. It is even more important if the world becomes increasingly carbon-constrained. Mdm Chair, let me move onto another key priority of the SSB: ensuring good air quality, which Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and other Members have spoken about. Indeed, just this week, the World Health Organization reported that worldwide, more than 0.5 million children die every year, due to air pollution. Over the years, we have taken steps to improve Singapore\\'s air quality, all to safeguard the health of our population. Measures include tightening industrial emission standards, updating emission standards for new vehicles and introducing schemes to turn over older, more polluting vehicles. Just last year, we tightened the emission standards for new motorcycles to the latest Euro 4 standards. These measures have made a difference. NEA\\'s studies show that the amount of pollutants emitted by vehicles have fallen by between 20% and 35%, over the last decade. However, we have still some way to go to meet our SSB targets. I announced last year that my Ministry would conduct a review on the diesel vehicle landscape, given rising global concerns over the health and environmental impact of diesel emissions. Diesel vehicles are a major source of local air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Studies have found that PM can penetrate the lungs and contribute to heart attacks, strokes and even dementia; while NOx becomes ground level ozone, which can result in respiratory problems. It is not surprising that many cities around the world have taken drastic steps to limit diesel vehicles within their city centres. Given these concerns, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Chia Shi-Lu have asked for an update on our progress. As part of our review, we commissioned Asst Prof Lynette Cheah from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) to study the impact of diesel vehicles and the availability of alternative technologies. The study found that there are indeed cleaner alternatives for certain classes of vehicles. At the same time, we recognise these alternatives also have limitations and may require infrastructure that is not widely available today. Nevertheless, my Ministry will explore ways with other agencies to encourage the adoption of viable alternatives to diesel vehicles. The volumetric diesel duty, which the Minister for Finance introduced two weeks ago, is in line with our plans. A usage-based tax better accounts for the harmful effects of each litre of diesel fuel used. We hope that this will encourage individuals and companies to optimise their use of diesel fuel, and even switch to alternative technologies with lower emissions. Apart from this, we will continue with our three-pronged approach in managing vehicular emissions. Firstly, we encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles, such as low emission hybrid cars, which Mr Louis Ng spoke about. The Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) was first designed to nudge consumers towards vehicles with lower carbon emissions. This remains important as vehicles contribute the second largest share of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions after-industries. However, we now need to revise CEVS to include tailpipe emissions of harmful air pollutants on top of carbon dioxide. The revised CEVS will be renamed as the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES). To incentivise the purchase of car and taxi models which are more environmentally friendly overall, the VES rebate or surcharge will be determined by the worst performing pollutant. This incentive framework has worked well in the past, and we will continue to review its effectiveness. Secondly, we inspect vehicles already on the road to minimise harmful emissions from them. The in-use emission standard for diesel vehicles was already tightened in January 2014. We will now introduce new in-use emission standards for petrol vehicles and motorcycles, similar to those already in place in Europe and Japan. These standards are designed to be easily met by properly maintained vehicles. The new standards will take effect on 1 April 2018, and will help minimise excessive emissions due to vehicle defects or poor maintenance. Thirdly, we encourage the removal of older and more polluting vehicles. To incentivise this, we will revise the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS). The ETS has been successful with over 27,000 older diesel vehicles being replaced by newer ones, resulting in significant reductions in NOx and PM. We will extend the scheme for Euro II and III diesel commercial vehicles that turn over to Euro 6 and equivalent models, for two years from August 2017. Given industry feedback, as well as the findings that Light Goods Vehicles (LGVs) remain a major contributor of diesel pollution due to their large population, the scheme will also be enhanced by increasing the COE bonus for LGVs from 13% to 35%. We hope that through this, more diesel commercial vehicles and buses will switch to Euro 6 models or cleaner electric hybrids or petrol alternatives. Transboundary haze − as a small city-state, clean air is not just a local issue. Forest and peatland fires in the region can produce haze which affects us. Transboundary haze is not only detrimental to the social and economic well-being of Southeast Asian nations, it represents a major setback to the global effort to fight climate change. A scientific study has shown that the 2015 fires in Indonesia released nearly 1 gigaton of greenhouse gases. Daily emissions during that haze period were even higher than that of the entire European Union. Fortunately, the relatively wet Southwest Monsoon season in 2016 and active efforts by the Indonesian government have prevented a repeat of the 2015 haze. However, as we approach the next dry season, we appreciate the recent commitment by the Indonesian government to take action to prevent fires. In fact, as we speak, the Riau Province is under emergency alert for potential fires. It is important that we continue to send a strong deterrent message to errant companies responsible for these fires, that they must change their ways. That is why we enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014. We will continue to take all steps necessary to enforce the THPA, while ensuring that we operate within the ambit of international law. Businesses and the general public can play their part too. Large companies should especially ensure that sustainable practices extend throughout their entire supply chain. I am glad that last year, WWF-Singapore, together with Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, launched the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil. This alliance aims to transform the palm oil industry by increasing the availability and usage of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) in the region. At the same time, the Singapore Environment Council has enhanced the criteria for the Singapore Green Label for pulp and paper products to take into account the companies\\' efforts to prevent fires on their plantations and manage their plantations on peatland. With the enhanced label, consumers will be better able to identify paper companies with sustainable business practices and make their choices accordingly. As Mr Louis Ng has pointed out, regional cooperation remains essential to tackle the haze problem. Last year, ASEAN member states came together to develop the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control. This is a laudable development and underscores the region\\'s commitment to realise the vision of a Haze-free ASEAN by 2020. We all look forward to the completion of the ASEAN study on the social, health and economic impacts of the 2015 haze crisis, which will consolidate the case for the ASEAN member states to strengthen efforts to prevent the recurrence of haze. Mdm Chair, I have laid out our plans to secure clean energy and clean air. Now let me turn to clean water. Firstly, I appreciate all who have given their comments on the water price revision over the past week and during the COS, and the many Ministers who have responded. I would like to revisit our water story. To do this, let me begin with \"the tale of two countries\" − the Netherlands and Singapore. Both our countries face acute water problems. However, the Dutch have a different problem from us − that of too much water. They have plenty of water from rivers, and much of the country lies below sea level and is prone to flooding. The massive flood of 1953 in which thousands perished is etched in their national memory. A few months ago, I visited the small town of Zuidplas, the lowest point of Netherlands and all of Europe. Members can see the man standing there, below the marker which says 7.8m below sea level? This marker shows that people in Zuidplas live 7.8m below sea level and actually are hardly aware of it. Even so, people all over Netherlands are always reminded that the rivers could overflow anytime, inundating their homes and destroying their livelihoods. Thus, to adapt, the Dutch over time built a complex system of dykes, pumps and water storage capabilities across the country. This was possible because each household contributed its share of water taxes, establishing the world\\'s first and only water bank which could finance large investments. In fact, this bank was instrumental in the recovery and the aftermath of the 1953 floods. Today, the Dutch continues to pour over EUR$400 million into flood protection each year. Climate change threatens catastrophes if they do not. This capability has turned into a great advantage. They have attracted water intensive industries to invest and their expertise is exported globally. Even Singapore is now learning how to construct a polder at Pulau Tekong with their help. We know that the Singapore Story is at the other extreme. We do not have enough water. But we must take the same determined approach as the Dutch. We have strived relentlessly to secure reliable and good quality water supply through innovation, sound management and a national awareness of our unique situation. Our strategy involves not just long-term planning, but also right-pricing, and water conservation measures. All these levers work in tandem. Let me touch on planning. Planning and investing in water resources ahead of time is in our DNA. This is even more critical in the face of looming challenges of climate change to water security, and this applies around the world. We have only to look at Linggiu Reservoir, which is about a third full now, and can dry up if current abstractions continue and prolonged dry weather returns, unpredicted. It has always worried us because a dry Linggiu Reservoir will be disastrous for both Singapore and Johor in many ways. The Dutch will recall they did not pay heed to the 1928 and 1934 studies, which repeatedly warned that their dykes were inadequate. Even when high water in 1943 reached the dykes, only simple repairs were made, because they were distracted even after World War II was over. The fact is nobody felt like spending a vast amount of money on raising the dykes. After all, there were no floods for years. So when the storm surge of 1953 happened, water broke through the dykes and claimed 1,800 lives. For us, because we were adequately prepared in 2014, the prolonged dry weather in Singapore did not cost us dearly. But low rainfall continued to take a toll on Linggiu in 2015 and 2016, leaving it at its lowest level of 20% in October 2016. For PUB, it is always about ensuring resilience in our water supply so that disruptions do not occur to our businesses and no Singaporeans will die of thirst. How have we done this? Last year, PUB completed its latest review of the Water Master Plan, a strategic blueprint for our water till 2060. The plan provides for development of NEWater and desalination plants to meet up to 85% of our water demand by 2060, as well as new pipelines for drinking water and used water. We are making good progress on the plans. Singapore\\'s fifth NEWater plant, located at Changi, officially opened in January this year. The third desalination plant in Tuas will be completed this year, and the fourth and fifth desalination plants in Marina East and Jurong Island are underway. Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), which includes the new water reclamation plant at Tuas, is on track for completion by 2025. All these have now become critical so that we have a resilient water supply when the water does not favour us. The Dutch has taken a leaf from the lesson of history and likewise planned ahead and built storm barriers, one of which is the largest moving structures on earth, to defend against exceptional storm surges and the new climate predictions. We also need to maintain and upgrade our existing water assets, as the Dutch has done with the dykes. As our infrastructure ages, PUB will accelerate renewal plans to minimise pipe leaks and supply interruptions. Our unaccounted-for-water losses, which include leaks from our supply network, are around 5%. This is among the lowest worldwide. In London, leakage is about one-fifth of water demand. We cannot afford that. It equates to losing all the water produced by two or three desalination plants. That brings me to water conservation, another key lever in our system, which Mr Gan spoke about. My Ministry and PUB have a suite of measures, in addition to right-pricing, to promote greater water savings for households and businesses. In 2016, households used 148 litres of water per capita per day, down significantly from a decade ago. We still have some way to go to reach our SSB target of 140 litres by 2030, not to mention trying to achieve even lowest levels as seen in cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. If each of us can save 10 litres of water per day, that is almost half a desalination plant. Over the past weeks, I have been inspired by the many stories of people who have gone the extra mile to conserve water. Some save the rinsed water discharged from washing machines for toilet flushing, while others used the water from washing rice to water their plants. HDB residents are now used to having their corridors washed every four weeks rather than two weeks. This is the right spirit. We should do more together. To help water saving initiatives, PUB will introduce several new measures. As part of our plans to phase out less water efficient products, PUB will raise the minimum standards to two-tick rating for sales, supply and installation of water fittings from April 2019. PUB will also extend labelling requirements to dishwashers from October 2018. PUB will also introduce two new water conservation programmes for households. First, PUB will roll out a community project for lower income households to replace their existing nine-litre water closets with more efficient ones. This can help them save up to 10% in their monthly water bills. Second, PUB will be installing smart shower devices for 10,000 new homes as a demonstration project. The smart shower device provides real-time information on water consumption during showers. An earlier small scale study found that a person could save up to five litres a day using these devices. If the positive effects are validated in the demonstration project, PUB may roll out the devices to even more households. As for businesses, we will continue to work with them to optimise water use. For large users, PUB has since 2015 required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP), which help companies better understand to manage their water consumption. At a recent consultation, some companies, including SSMC, a wafer fabrication facility, said that they invest in water saving measures as a matter of principle, even though water formed only a small part of their costs. I am heartened that, for these companies, they are driven as much by water conservation DNA as company profit and loss (P&amp;L). I hope many more businesses follow suit. Let me now turn to drainage. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah pointed out, climate change will pose challenges to flood management as well. PUB will continue with its island-wide programme to rehabilitate and upgrade our drains to higher design standards. This year, we will start work at another 27 locations. The Stamford Detention Tank will be ready this year, while the Stamford Diversion Canal and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal will be completed in 2018. These works, when ready, will enhance flood protection for the catchments. Our water bodies are critical assets, but we have to make them accessible. Just over a decade ago, we launched the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, to allow Singaporeans to own and enjoy our water resources. I am pleased to share that 34 ABC Waters projects have been opened to the community to date. This year, we can expect the opening of four new ABC Waters projects across the island, including Pang Sua Pond and Siglap Canal, which should be opened later this month. Another four projects at Sungei Tampines (Tampines Ave 7 to TPE), Chestnut Drive Outlet Drain, Sungei Simpang Kanan and Alexandra Sub-drain A will commence construction this year. I hope this serves, as a constant reminder of our precious asset. Mdm Chair, I have touched on our approach to water to ensure that we do not have too little and to help us manage when there is too much. Many of us are familiar with the Singapore Water Story. Perhaps there is a risk of over-familiarity, a certain jadedness from one too many Social Studies lesson. Just like water flowing from taps everywhere, it can become invisible, overlooked, undervalued, just like the people in Zuidplas who are not aware that they live 7.8 metres below sea level. This month, we celebrate World Water Day, to highlight the importance of water sustainability. It is a timely reminder that even today, 663 million people around the world do not have access to clean water. It is in this context that we should relive, and encounter afresh our Water Story, the story of what it takes for our people to remain free. Our Water Story is not concluded; it is not history. Instead, the Water Story is a living story, and continues to be written by all Singaporeans today, whether in producing it or conserving it. Sometimes, it is in the larger things, in PUB continuously investing for water supply and their unceasingly effort to discover new technologies. Sometimes, it is the smaller things, like when we use a mug to brush our teeth or when the coffee-shop downstairs installs automated cup washing machines that use less water. These are all stories that make our Water Story. Mdm Chair, I hand over now to Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor to address our other strategies to make Singapore a sustainable and liveable home.'), ('Amy Khor Lean Suan', 'Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources', 'MSE', 'Thank you. Mdm Chair, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said: \"After Independence, I searched for some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries. I settled for a clean and green Singapore\". Thus, Mr Lee, together with the pioneer generation of Singaporeans, embarked on an unprecedented journey to transform Singapore from a slum to a Garden City. Today, as we work towards further enhancing Singapore\\'s liveability, we too need to think and act boldly on matter relating to the environment as Mr Lee did. All the more so, as we face huge challenges, such as manpower constraints, an ageing population and acute land scarcity. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Miss Cheng Li Hui raised relevant points on waste management. Let me first outline my Ministry\\'s overall strategy and priorities in managing waste. There are three key waste streams of greatest concern to us. The first is electrical and electronic waste, or e-waste for short. As Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Louis Ng have highlighted, about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste are generated annually. Currently, consumers can participate in e-waste recycling programmes which industry stakeholders voluntarily provide. For example, StarHub provides e-waste recycling bins at almost 280 convenient locations, such as shopping malls and community centres, through its RENEW programme. The e-waste collected is sent to recyclers such as Tes-Amm, where resources such as copper, aluminium and gold are extracted for reuse. We are currently consulting industry stakeholders on an enhanced national e-waste management system, which would cover both the collection and disposal of e-waste. Some countries, such as Germany and South Korea, have implemented similar systems. We will take into account our local context, such as product coverage and the physical and financial responsibilities of key stakeholders when developing the system. More details will be released later this year. Mr Ng spoke about HCFCs. Singapore is a party to the Montreal Protocol, and will phase out the use of HCFCs by 2030. We have put in place measures to help us achieve this, such as controls on the import of HCFCs for local use. Apart from regulatory control, we encourage the recycling of refrigerants recovered from refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Local recycling facilities such as Vemac Services Pte Ltd recover refrigerants from decommissioned industrial and commercial systems. We will monitor developments in this area, and assess the feasibility of implementing a management framework for HCFCs, taking into consideration the risk to human health, technical limitations, and the potential compliance costs which businesses would have to bear. The second concern is packaging waste, which makes up around one-third of our domestic waste. Since the launch of our voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement in 2007, we have achieved a cumulative reduction of more than 32,000 tonnes of packaging waste, but more can be done. We are exploring possible regulations for businesses, such as mandatory reporting of packaging placed on the local market and the submission of packaging waste reduction plans, over the next two to four years. We will study the issues and announce the details when ready. The third concern is food waste, which Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Miss Cheng have raised. My Ministry has been pursuing several initiatives on this front. We are encouraging more on-site food waste initiatives in individual entities, such as hotels, shopping malls, educational institutions and hawker centres. Mr Liang asked for an update on the district-level food waste treatment pilot in Clementi. Since the end of last year, source-segregated food waste from nine sites including schools, army camps and a food court has been transported to a demonstration facility in the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant. About three tonnes of food waste are collected daily, but we aim to increase this to 15 tonnes a day. If successful, this process will allow us to recover energy from food waste more efficiently. Good practices start from young and our schools have always been an enthusiastic partner in our recycling efforts. As part of these efforts, we will be launching food waste digesters in 10 schools in the second quarter this year. Under the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), we have set an overall recycling target of 70% by 2030. Over the last few years, our overall recycling rate has been around 60%. The non-domestic sector comprising industries and commercial premises have achieved a recycling rate of 77%. However, our domestic recycling rates have stagnated at around 20% in recent years. More needs to be done to put recycling at the heart of our culture. Referring to Assoc Prof Faishal and Miss Cheng\\'s queries, we will be reshaping the infrastructure of our physical environment to make recycling more convenient for households. We hope this will bring us closer to our domestic recycling rate of 30% by 2030. Since January 2014, all new HDB Build-to-Order (BTO) flats have installed recycling chutes adjacent to centralised refuse chutes at every level. Studies have shown that households living in apartments with dual chute systems recycle up to three times more than those in apartments which do not have such facilities. We are now ready to widen the adoption of such systems. The provision of recycling chutes will be extended to private residential developments. Buildings taller than four storeys in all new non-landed private residential developments will be required to install dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. Regarding Miss Cheng\\'s query on plans to reduce contamination rates of recyclables, education remains key. Through continued public education programmes in schools and at grassroots events, we encourage everyone to practise responsible recycling habits and ensure that only items which are suitable for recycling are deposited in the recycling bins and recycling chutes. As Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Miss Cheng have observed, our current methods of manual waste collection in the older flats are manpower-intensive and unsustainable. Moving forward, we will transform our waste collection system into a more efficient, manpower-light one. The Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) is an automated system which transports waste by air suction through a network of pipes to a central collection station. This reduces our reliance on manpower to collect refuse. The whole system will be enclosed, and residents will enjoy a more liveable environment, with a reduction in pest nuisance, odours and exposed waste. There is increasing adoption of PWCS in Singapore. In the public sector, HDB piloted the PWCS at Yuhua estate in Jurong under the HDB Greenprint Programme and will be installing PWCS in new HDB areas, such as Tampines North and Bidadari. Private developers, such as City Developments Limited and CapitaLand, have done likewise. To date, more than 100 condominium developments, such as the Palette at Pasir Ris and Sky Habitat at Bishan, have installed the PWCS. Therefore, to improve the efficiency and hygiene of waste collection, all new non-landed private residential developments with at least 500 dwelling units will need to be installed with PWCS. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. We have consulted extensively with industry players, including the Real Estate Developers\\' Association of Singapore (REDAS), and have taken their feedback into account in determining the threshold limits and the implementation date. We will also work closely with managing agents and community partners to educate residents on the correct use of the PWCS. To reap greater economies of scale, my Ministry is studying the feasibility of implementing PWCS at the district level, where different developments can be connected to the same network. An automated and enclosed network of district-level PWCS will bring us even closer to our vision of a manpower-efficient waste collection system in a liveable environment. Next, I turn to smoking. As Mr Ng highlighted, our long-term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public spaces except at designated areas. Last year, we extended smoking prohibition to areas around reservoirs, and more than 400 parks. With this, more than 32,000 premises are now smoke-free in Singapore. We will look into progressively extending the smoking prohibition in other areas. We recently set up five Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs) in Orchard Road to study the effectiveness of DSAs in reducing smoking in a commercial area. We hope this will encourage smokers to be considerate by smoking only at the DSAs. This study, when completed at the end of the year, will inform us on the public\\'s reception towards DSAs, and give us insight into the location and design considerations of DSAs. We will take into consideration the results of this study before we consider extending the implementation of DSAs to other locations. On public cleanliness, we have stepped up enforcement against littering. NEA issued more than 31,000 tickets to litterbugs last year. This is almost 18% more than 2015 and the highest since 2009. To Mr Gan Thiam Poh\\'s question about the effectiveness of CWOs, over the past five years, less than 6% of litterbugs who have undergone CWOs have been caught for littering again. Mr Gan also asked about the effectiveness of cameras against high-rise littering. NEA adopted the use of surveillance cameras in August 2012 and has since made more than 4,100 deployments and taken more than 3,300 enforcement actions against high-rise litterbugs. These cameras create an effective deterrent effect, as only about 1% of high-rise litterbugs are caught offending again. But beyond enforcement, the most effective and sustainable way to have a litter-free environment is to inculcate the right social values, so that the responsibility for keeping Singapore clean and caring for our environment is part of everyone\\'s DNA. Madam, our hawker centres are a unique and integral part of Singapore\\'s identity. Not only do they serve an important function of providing affordable food in a clean environment, they are key social spaces where people from all walks of life can enjoy a meal together. The Government had previously announced that 20 new hawker centres will be ready by 2027. This will add about 800 more cooked food stalls across the island. I am pleased to update that three new hawker centres have been completed so far, with the latest being at Our Tampines Hub, which commenced operations in November last year. As highlighted by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, NEA has been exploring alternative management models by engaging socially-conscious operators, such as NTUC Foodfare, Fei Siong and OTMH, as managing agents for our hawker centres. The feedback from both hawkers and patrons of these centres have been largely positive. NFC, in particular, is an established socially-conscious operator and has been managing the existing Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre since 2014. Rentals at these centres have remained unchanged and food prices have been kept largely stable. Besides monitoring food prices for affordability and ensuring that any price revision is justified, these operators have put in place initiatives like offering bulk purchase of ingredients to help hawkers reduce their cost, or putting in place productivity measures, such as centralised dish washing, to help hawkers address their manpower constraints. Given the encouraging outcomes of these initial efforts, we have extended this approach to other hawker centres. We have appointed NFC to manage a group of five existing centres with incumbent stallholders and two new centres. Allowing NFC to manage a bundle of hawker centres will enable them to have the necessary scale to enhance the vibrancy and hygiene standards across more hawker centres, as well as the flexibility to experiment with new ideas and processes, to benefit patrons and hawkers. This is the first expanded pilot and we would need to evaluate the results of this approach before we decide on the next steps. We are calling for tenders for the two new centres at Yishun and Jurong West. The tenders are open to all socially-conscious operators who are interested to manage the centres. We will select the best tender proposal to ensure that our hawker centres continue to fulfil the fundamental objective of providing affordable food in a hygienic environment while allowing our hawkers to make a decent livelihood. To Assoc Prof Daniel Goh\\'s query on subsidised rent in new centres, subsidised rents were offered to encourage street hawkers to relocate to hawker centres in the 1970s and early 1980s. Some hawkers were also allowed to operate stalls at subsidised rents under the previous hardship scheme, which was discontinued in 1990. Since then, all new hawkers are required to pay rental at market rate. Hence, there are no subsidised rents in all our new centres. Last year, I announced the formation of a Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee to review and make recommendations to improve the management of hawker centres and ensure the sustainability of the hawker trade to benefit Singaporeans. Following a year of extensive consultations with many stakeholders, including hawkers, patrons, cleaning service providers and members of the public, the Committee submitted the recommendations to the Minister in February this year. Mr Liang asked about the response to the Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee\\'s recommendations. I am pleased to announce that the Ministry has accepted all the recommendations. We will, therefore, work together with relevant stakeholders to implement them. Let me highlight a few plans that we will put in place in the coming months. First, one key recommendation is for the Government to provide training opportunities and pathways for aspiring hawkers − young or the not-so-young. For a start, we are working with the People\\'s Association to develop a \"Hawker Fare\" series of culinary classes, starting in May. Members of the public can learn how to cook hawker dishes, like chicken rice, yong tau foo and mee goreng from the veteran hawkers themselves. While not all trainees will eventually become hawkers, such courses will also help to generate interest in hawker food and culture among Singaporeans, and contribute to sustaining the hawker trade in the long run. There are a handful of culinary certification courses in the market today. However, these courses are largely not tailored for the hawker trade. Hence, in addition to the Hawker Fare series that focuses on culinary skills, we are working with ITE to develop a separate short course to teach aspiring hawkers relevant business management skills, like basic profit and loss analysis and how to tender for a stall, to help them set up and manage a hawker business. More details will be released later in the year. We welcome other interested parties, such as training providers, to work with us to provide appropriate training to aspiring hawkers. In the second half of this year, we will set up a one-stop information and service centre, which will provide useful information to both existing and aspiring hawkers, like how to tender for a stall, where to go for courses on food hygiene and the hawker trade, and the range of kitchen automation equipment available. During the second half of the year, we will also be launching an incubation stall programme, where some hawker stalls at several hawker centres will be pre-fitted by NEA to let eligible aspiring hawkers try out being a hawker for a period of, say, six months. This will allow them to decide if they are cut out for the trade without putting in heavy investments. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to say a few words in Mandarin. The Committee\\'s second recommendation focuses on improving productivity of the hawker centres. The Committee recommended that the Government implement productivity measures in the hawker centres to help hawkers reduce their workload and address the manpower challenges that hawkers are facing. In fact, productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing and cashless payment, are already a requirement in the new hawker centres. Some stallholders in existing centres have also voluntarily subscribed to centralised dishwashing services, such as those at Boon Lay Place Market and Food Centre. The Government will set aside $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives, which will help lighten the workload of hawkers and address manpower constraints. This will include some funding to increase the adoption of centre-level productivity initiatives, like centralised dish-washing and stall-level productivity initiatives like the purchase of kitchen automation equipment. We recognise that hawkers are concerned about the cost of productivity initiatives. Hence, as noted earlier, to alleviate these cost concerns, the Government will set aside about $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives in hawker centres. The funding will support the progressive reconfiguration of up to 25 existing centres over the next few years to facilitate the rolling out of centre-level productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing integrated with tray return, and cashless payment solutions similar to those seen at the hawker centre in Our Tampines Hub or Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. We will also co-fund up to 70% of the operating cost of such initiatives for hawkers in these centres for a period of time. This will help lower the initial cost of adoption of productivity measures that will help realise manpower and cost savings in the long term. To promote stall-level productivity, we will set up a Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant to co-fund the purchase of suitable kitchen automation equipment for cooked food stallholders. Each stallholder can claim 80% of the qualifying cost of the equipment on a reimbursement basis, up to a total of $5,000 within three years. Hawkers can start applying for this grant in the third quarter of this year. Some hawkers are already using kitchen automation equipment. When I visited Smith Street Food Centre recently, I came across a cooked food stallholder who sells steamed yam cakes. She uses an automated stirrer to mix ingredients which reduces a lot of manual labour. Through the Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant, we hope to encourage a greater adoption of such labour-saving equipment. Third, more than just dining spaces, hawker centres are places where Singaporeans of all walks of life can interact. In response to the Committee\\'s recommendation to encourage regular organised activities at hawker centres in a sustainable manner, I am happy to announce that we will be providing funding support of $2,000 per event to adopters of hawker centres, up to an annual cap of $10,000 for each adopter, to organise events to enhance the vibrancy of hawker centres. Such events can enhance patrons\\' dining experience at hawker centres, while increasing footfall and benefitting hawkers. Fourth, on graciousness in hawker centres, people recognise that the act of tray-return is a kind and considerate behaviour to be cultivated. To Mr Png Eng Huat\\'s question, we introduced tray-return to hawker centres in 2012 and since 2015, tray-return facilities have been implemented in all hawker centres. The tray-return rates vary, with the highest tray-return rates at Tiong Bahru Market, Blk 157 Tampines Street 11 and Our Tampines Hub. We have also been working on making tray-return stations more visible, prominent and accessible, as seen in the newer hawker centres. To study how to further improve tray return rates, we are also currently running a pilot involving the use of specially designed tray decals and working with our cleaning contractor at Zion Riverside Food Centre to train the cleaners to encourage patrons to clear their trays after their meals. These initiatives that we are rolling out are part of our efforts to ensure the sustainability and viability of the hawker trade. They should help to support both existing and aspiring hawkers. This in turn will allow Singaporeans to continue enjoying affordable food in a clean and hygienic environment. Lastly, let me give an update on our dengue cases. Despite earlier concerns that warmer weather would contribute to a spike in dengue cases to beyond 30,000 last year, we managed to bring the situation under control. There were instead 13,000 dengue cases last year. The World Health Organization has also commended our efforts in managing the Zika outbreak. However, we cannot be complacent, and should remain vigilant by doing the five-step Mozzie Wipeout. Mr Gan asked for an update on the small-scale field studies of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes that commenced last year. We have seen encouraging results so far. About half of the Aedes aegypti eggs collected from a trial site were unable to hatch. Our panel of international experts recently affirmed the good progress and expressed their support of NEA\\'s plan to move to the next phase of the suppression trial later this year. Mdm Chair, in conclusion, everyone must take responsibility for the environment. To achieve the vision of a liveable and sustainable Singapore, as laid out in our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, everyone needs to be part of the solution. The little things that we do, like throwing away our trash properly, recycling our waste responsibly and returning our trays with the crockery properly, can make a big difference. With the support of this House, Singaporeans can rise up and do this together.')]</td>\n",

       "      <td>Madam, regarding the recent announcement on carbon tax, though it is in the right direction to reduce carbon emission, it will, however, have an impact on the industries financial sustainability and ultimately the workers and consumers. Are there other measures that we can put in place to incentivise the individual firms to be prudent and compel them to use alternative sources of energy? With this tax, are we on track to meeting our commitment to lower carbon emission? Has the Ministry explored other initiatives considering the level of carbon emitted in our day-to-day life may have compounded the problem? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider further reviewing the following. One, creating greater awareness of the importance of addressing climate change and its implication on Singapore and its people. This can be done through schools, at workplaces and in public places with educational posters and documentary films. Extensively promoting these recycling, reducing or replacing the usage of plastics. This can be done by providing greater access and incentives for one to exchange empty bottles for coins − a practice found in Sweden. Pushing for consumers to bring their recyclable bags and not providing the alternative of plastic carrier bags could also be considered. It is the age old culture that we need to reignite. About 19% of carbon emission comes from transportation. Can we do more in getting electric vehicles instead of petroleum cars to ply our roads if our effort to make Singaporeans switch to public transport remains a challenge? Can we better incentivise companies and individuals to encourage such efforts? The food we eat is what we are and what the environmental impact will be. It is important to educate Singaporeans on food that poses negative impact on the environment. \"The biggest intervention people could make towards reducing their carbon footprints is to eat significantly less red meat,\" said Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds. A research, led by scientists at the Oxford Martin School, found that shifting to a mostly vegetarian diet, or even simply cutting down meat consumption to within accepted health guidelines, would make a large dent in greenhouse gases. Adhering to health guidelines on meat consumption could cut global food-related emissions by nearly a third by 2050, while widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet would bring down emissions by 63%. Lastly, the eco-friendly award is a timely reminder —</td>\n",

       "      <td>[('Masagos Zulkifli Bin Masagos Mohamad', 'Minister for the Environment and Water Resources', 'MSE', 'The environment has been at the top of our minds this Budget. I thank everyone who has spoken about the need to protect our resources for future generations. Singapore is not alone. Many other countries are paying closer attention to the environment, even as they grow their economies. We have a plan called the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB). This plan brings together all that we are doing, in pursuit of a Liveable and Endearing Home, a Vibrant and Sustainable City, and an Active and Gracious Community. I am glad to say that we have made progress over the course of 2016, and remain on track to meet the SSB targets progressively by 2030. A strong commitment to sustainability remains critical as we build our future economy. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms K Thanaletchimi have highlighted, it will take not only Government support but also the collective effort of every individual to realise this SSB vision. That is why we launched the Sustainable Singapore Movement in July last year to galvanise the community to action. Climate change. While we stand on solid footing, the road ahead is uncertain. A major concern for us is climate change, a far-reaching threat that we can already see and feel today. Our Meteorological Service recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1929, when we started keeping temperature records. In recent years, our water managers, too, have had a foretaste of the looming challenge of coping with extended dry spells on the one hand and higher intensity rainfall on the other. Singapore has to plan ahead to deal with climate change impacts. We will not only need to protect our buildings, coasts and infrastructure, but also foster greater awareness, so that we are a resilient people. As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore is committed to fulfilling our pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Both households and industry play a role in this, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh has noted. Industry, however, contributes the lion\\'s share − 60% − of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions. We, therefore, need to focus our efforts here. The upcoming carbon tax to be imposed on large emitters, as announced by the Minister for Finance, will help send the right price signal to industries to reduce their emissions when and where it makes the most business sense. The carbon tax, however, is not a panacea for achieving our 2030 emissions pledge. We will need other measures to complement the tax. That is why we introduced the Energy Conservation Act (ECA) in 2013, to put in place measures, such as mandatory energy management, and encourage companies to enhance their energy efficiency. I am pleased to report that we have made progress on this front since then. Let me give an example. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to show some slides please. Murata Electronics Singapore, which manufactures electronic components, is becoming an early adopter of efficient motors. Murata is replacing 50 motors with higher efficiency ones. This will save Murata some 160 MWh of electricity each year. These annual savings of $21,000 in energy costs will last throughout the 15-year lifespan of the motors. Murata is a good example of how industrial energy efficiency measures can benefit the environment as well as the company\\'s bottom line, but, for the industry sector as a whole, there is clearly more to be done. Data collected shows that our companies achieved an annual energy efficiency improvement rate of 0.6% in 2015, a slight improvement over 0.4% in 2014. This is still low. To meet our 2030 pledge, we need to work towards the 1% to 2% improvement rates achieved by leading countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands. On a positive note, companies that I spoke to at a recent consultation session recognised the importance of improving their energy efficiency. They, however, mentioned that they faced operational and capability constraints. Some also asked for best practices and useful data to be shared with them. We are studying their feedback and, for a start, we will amend the Energy Conservation Act to introduce a new set of initiatives to help companies improve their energy efficiency. First, all ECA-registered companies will now be required to implement structured energy management systems and conduct regular energy efficiency opportunity assessments. Second, companies expanding their facilities will need to factor energy efficiency into their designs upfront, as well as measure and report energy usage for key energy-consuming systems. Third, NEA\\'s data shows that a substantial proportion of common industrial equipment is inefficient. Hence, Minimum Energy Performance Standards will be introduced, first, for motors, and then other systems and equipment progressively. These practices are in line with that of leading jurisdictions and will help companies to adopt more efficient equipment, conserve energy and enjoy life cycle cost savings. To pave the way for a robust carbon tax regime, we need to have a sound Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. The ECA will thus be amended to require larger industrial emitters to improve the quality of measurement and reporting processes for their greenhouse gas emissions. This will help companies to better understand and manage their emissions. My Ministry will continue to work closely with the NCCS and MTI to consult the affected companies on how to best achieve this. We have also received feedback on the need to improve the current incentive schemes. NEA will be consolidating their existing energy efficiency incentive schemes into a single fund called the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F). NEA will redesign the E2F to better support companies to identify and undertake energy efficiency retrofits. We will, especially help our SMEs by co-funding up to 30% of their investments in energy efficient technologies. Further details will be released by NEA. We need a sustainable way to grow our economy. It is even more important if the world becomes increasingly carbon-constrained. Mdm Chair, let me move onto another key priority of the SSB: ensuring good air quality, which Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and other Members have spoken about. Indeed, just this week, the World Health Organization reported that worldwide, more than 0.5 million children die every year, due to air pollution. Over the years, we have taken steps to improve Singapore\\'s air quality, all to safeguard the health of our population. Measures include tightening industrial emission standards, updating emission standards for new vehicles and introducing schemes to turn over older, more polluting vehicles. Just last year, we tightened the emission standards for new motorcycles to the latest Euro 4 standards. These measures have made a difference. NEA\\'s studies show that the amount of pollutants emitted by vehicles have fallen by between 20% and 35%, over the last decade. However, we have still some way to go to meet our SSB targets. I announced last year that my Ministry would conduct a review on the diesel vehicle landscape, given rising global concerns over the health and environmental impact of diesel emissions. Diesel vehicles are a major source of local air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Studies have found that PM can penetrate the lungs and contribute to heart attacks, strokes and even dementia; while NOx becomes ground level ozone, which can result in respiratory problems. It is not surprising that many cities around the world have taken drastic steps to limit diesel vehicles within their city centres. Given these concerns, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Chia Shi-Lu have asked for an update on our progress. As part of our review, we commissioned Asst Prof Lynette Cheah from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) to study the impact of diesel vehicles and the availability of alternative technologies. The study found that there are indeed cleaner alternatives for certain classes of vehicles. At the same time, we recognise these alternatives also have limitations and may require infrastructure that is not widely available today. Nevertheless, my Ministry will explore ways with other agencies to encourage the adoption of viable alternatives to diesel vehicles. The volumetric diesel duty, which the Minister for Finance introduced two weeks ago, is in line with our plans. A usage-based tax better accounts for the harmful effects of each litre of diesel fuel used. We hope that this will encourage individuals and companies to optimise their use of diesel fuel, and even switch to alternative technologies with lower emissions. Apart from this, we will continue with our three-pronged approach in managing vehicular emissions. Firstly, we encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles, such as low emission hybrid cars, which Mr Louis Ng spoke about. The Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) was first designed to nudge consumers towards vehicles with lower carbon emissions. This remains important as vehicles contribute the second largest share of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions after-industries. However, we now need to revise CEVS to include tailpipe emissions of harmful air pollutants on top of carbon dioxide. The revised CEVS will be renamed as the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES). To incentivise the purchase of car and taxi models which are more environmentally friendly overall, the VES rebate or surcharge will be determined by the worst performing pollutant. This incentive framework has worked well in the past, and we will continue to review its effectiveness. Secondly, we inspect vehicles already on the road to minimise harmful emissions from them. The in-use emission standard for diesel vehicles was already tightened in January 2014. We will now introduce new in-use emission standards for petrol vehicles and motorcycles, similar to those already in place in Europe and Japan. These standards are designed to be easily met by properly maintained vehicles. The new standards will take effect on 1 April 2018, and will help minimise excessive emissions due to vehicle defects or poor maintenance. Thirdly, we encourage the removal of older and more polluting vehicles. To incentivise this, we will revise the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS). The ETS has been successful with over 27,000 older diesel vehicles being replaced by newer ones, resulting in significant reductions in NOx and PM. We will extend the scheme for Euro II and III diesel commercial vehicles that turn over to Euro 6 and equivalent models, for two years from August 2017. Given industry feedback, as well as the findings that Light Goods Vehicles (LGVs) remain a major contributor of diesel pollution due to their large population, the scheme will also be enhanced by increasing the COE bonus for LGVs from 13% to 35%. We hope that through this, more diesel commercial vehicles and buses will switch to Euro 6 models or cleaner electric hybrids or petrol alternatives. Transboundary haze − as a small city-state, clean air is not just a local issue. Forest and peatland fires in the region can produce haze which affects us. Transboundary haze is not only detrimental to the social and economic well-being of Southeast Asian nations, it represents a major setback to the global effort to fight climate change. A scientific study has shown that the 2015 fires in Indonesia released nearly 1 gigaton of greenhouse gases. Daily emissions during that haze period were even higher than that of the entire European Union. Fortunately, the relatively wet Southwest Monsoon season in 2016 and active efforts by the Indonesian government have prevented a repeat of the 2015 haze. However, as we approach the next dry season, we appreciate the recent commitment by the Indonesian government to take action to prevent fires. In fact, as we speak, the Riau Province is under emergency alert for potential fires. It is important that we continue to send a strong deterrent message to errant companies responsible for these fires, that they must change their ways. That is why we enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014. We will continue to take all steps necessary to enforce the THPA, while ensuring that we operate within the ambit of international law. Businesses and the general public can play their part too. Large companies should especially ensure that sustainable practices extend throughout their entire supply chain. I am glad that last year, WWF-Singapore, together with Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, launched the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil. This alliance aims to transform the palm oil industry by increasing the availability and usage of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) in the region. At the same time, the Singapore Environment Council has enhanced the criteria for the Singapore Green Label for pulp and paper products to take into account the companies\\' efforts to prevent fires on their plantations and manage their plantations on peatland. With the enhanced label, consumers will be better able to identify paper companies with sustainable business practices and make their choices accordingly. As Mr Louis Ng has pointed out, regional cooperation remains essential to tackle the haze problem. Last year, ASEAN member states came together to develop the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control. This is a laudable development and underscores the region\\'s commitment to realise the vision of a Haze-free ASEAN by 2020. We all look forward to the completion of the ASEAN study on the social, health and economic impacts of the 2015 haze crisis, which will consolidate the case for the ASEAN member states to strengthen efforts to prevent the recurrence of haze. Mdm Chair, I have laid out our plans to secure clean energy and clean air. Now let me turn to clean water. Firstly, I appreciate all who have given their comments on the water price revision over the past week and during the COS, and the many Ministers who have responded. I would like to revisit our water story. To do this, let me begin with \"the tale of two countries\" − the Netherlands and Singapore. Both our countries face acute water problems. However, the Dutch have a different problem from us − that of too much water. They have plenty of water from rivers, and much of the country lies below sea level and is prone to flooding. The massive flood of 1953 in which thousands perished is etched in their national memory. A few months ago, I visited the small town of Zuidplas, the lowest point of Netherlands and all of Europe. Members can see the man standing there, below the marker which says 7.8m below sea level? This marker shows that people in Zuidplas live 7.8m below sea level and actually are hardly aware of it. Even so, people all over Netherlands are always reminded that the rivers could overflow anytime, inundating their homes and destroying their livelihoods. Thus, to adapt, the Dutch over time built a complex system of dykes, pumps and water storage capabilities across the country. This was possible because each household contributed its share of water taxes, establishing the world\\'s first and only water bank which could finance large investments. In fact, this bank was instrumental in the recovery and the aftermath of the 1953 floods. Today, the Dutch continues to pour over EUR$400 million into flood protection each year. Climate change threatens catastrophes if they do not. This capability has turned into a great advantage. They have attracted water intensive industries to invest and their expertise is exported globally. Even Singapore is now learning how to construct a polder at Pulau Tekong with their help. We know that the Singapore Story is at the other extreme. We do not have enough water. But we must take the same determined approach as the Dutch. We have strived relentlessly to secure reliable and good quality water supply through innovation, sound management and a national awareness of our unique situation. Our strategy involves not just long-term planning, but also right-pricing, and water conservation measures. All these levers work in tandem. Let me touch on planning. Planning and investing in water resources ahead of time is in our DNA. This is even more critical in the face of looming challenges of climate change to water security, and this applies around the world. We have only to look at Linggiu Reservoir, which is about a third full now, and can dry up if current abstractions continue and prolonged dry weather returns, unpredicted. It has always worried us because a dry Linggiu Reservoir will be disastrous for both Singapore and Johor in many ways. The Dutch will recall they did not pay heed to the 1928 and 1934 studies, which repeatedly warned that their dykes were inadequate. Even when high water in 1943 reached the dykes, only simple repairs were made, because they were distracted even after World War II was over. The fact is nobody felt like spending a vast amount of money on raising the dykes. After all, there were no floods for years. So when the storm surge of 1953 happened, water broke through the dykes and claimed 1,800 lives. For us, because we were adequately prepared in 2014, the prolonged dry weather in Singapore did not cost us dearly. But low rainfall continued to take a toll on Linggiu in 2015 and 2016, leaving it at its lowest level of 20% in October 2016. For PUB, it is always about ensuring resilience in our water supply so that disruptions do not occur to our businesses and no Singaporeans will die of thirst. How have we done this? Last year, PUB completed its latest review of the Water Master Plan, a strategic blueprint for our water till 2060. The plan provides for development of NEWater and desalination plants to meet up to 85% of our water demand by 2060, as well as new pipelines for drinking water and used water. We are making good progress on the plans. Singapore\\'s fifth NEWater plant, located at Changi, officially opened in January this year. The third desalination plant in Tuas will be completed this year, and the fourth and fifth desalination plants in Marina East and Jurong Island are underway. Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), which includes the new water reclamation plant at Tuas, is on track for completion by 2025. All these have now become critical so that we have a resilient water supply when the water does not favour us. The Dutch has taken a leaf from the lesson of history and likewise planned ahead and built storm barriers, one of which is the largest moving structures on earth, to defend against exceptional storm surges and the new climate predictions. We also need to maintain and upgrade our existing water assets, as the Dutch has done with the dykes. As our infrastructure ages, PUB will accelerate renewal plans to minimise pipe leaks and supply interruptions. Our unaccounted-for-water losses, which include leaks from our supply network, are around 5%. This is among the lowest worldwide. In London, leakage is about one-fifth of water demand. We cannot afford that. It equates to losing all the water produced by two or three desalination plants. That brings me to water conservation, another key lever in our system, which Mr Gan spoke about. My Ministry and PUB have a suite of measures, in addition to right-pricing, to promote greater water savings for households and businesses. In 2016, households used 148 litres of water per capita per day, down significantly from a decade ago. We still have some way to go to reach our SSB target of 140 litres by 2030, not to mention trying to achieve even lowest levels as seen in cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. If each of us can save 10 litres of water per day, that is almost half a desalination plant. Over the past weeks, I have been inspired by the many stories of people who have gone the extra mile to conserve water. Some save the rinsed water discharged from washing machines for toilet flushing, while others used the water from washing rice to water their plants. HDB residents are now used to having their corridors washed every four weeks rather than two weeks. This is the right spirit. We should do more together. To help water saving initiatives, PUB will introduce several new measures. As part of our plans to phase out less water efficient products, PUB will raise the minimum standards to two-tick rating for sales, supply and installation of water fittings from April 2019. PUB will also extend labelling requirements to dishwashers from October 2018. PUB will also introduce two new water conservation programmes for households. First, PUB will roll out a community project for lower income households to replace their existing nine-litre water closets with more efficient ones. This can help them save up to 10% in their monthly water bills. Second, PUB will be installing smart shower devices for 10,000 new homes as a demonstration project. The smart shower device provides real-time information on water consumption during showers. An earlier small scale study found that a person could save up to five litres a day using these devices. If the positive effects are validated in the demonstration project, PUB may roll out the devices to even more households. As for businesses, we will continue to work with them to optimise water use. For large users, PUB has since 2015 required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP), which help companies better understand to manage their water consumption. At a recent consultation, some companies, including SSMC, a wafer fabrication facility, said that they invest in water saving measures as a matter of principle, even though water formed only a small part of their costs. I am heartened that, for these companies, they are driven as much by water conservation DNA as company profit and loss (P&amp;L). I hope many more businesses follow suit. Let me now turn to drainage. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah pointed out, climate change will pose challenges to flood management as well. PUB will continue with its island-wide programme to rehabilitate and upgrade our drains to higher design standards. This year, we will start work at another 27 locations. The Stamford Detention Tank will be ready this year, while the Stamford Diversion Canal and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal will be completed in 2018. These works, when ready, will enhance flood protection for the catchments. Our water bodies are critical assets, but we have to make them accessible. Just over a decade ago, we launched the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, to allow Singaporeans to own and enjoy our water resources. I am pleased to share that 34 ABC Waters projects have been opened to the community to date. This year, we can expect the opening of four new ABC Waters projects across the island, including Pang Sua Pond and Siglap Canal, which should be opened later this month. Another four projects at Sungei Tampines (Tampines Ave 7 to TPE), Chestnut Drive Outlet Drain, Sungei Simpang Kanan and Alexandra Sub-drain A will commence construction this year. I hope this serves, as a constant reminder of our precious asset. Mdm Chair, I have touched on our approach to water to ensure that we do not have too little and to help us manage when there is too much. Many of us are familiar with the Singapore Water Story. Perhaps there is a risk of over-familiarity, a certain jadedness from one too many Social Studies lesson. Just like water flowing from taps everywhere, it can become invisible, overlooked, undervalued, just like the people in Zuidplas who are not aware that they live 7.8 metres below sea level. This month, we celebrate World Water Day, to highlight the importance of water sustainability. It is a timely reminder that even today, 663 million people around the world do not have access to clean water. It is in this context that we should relive, and encounter afresh our Water Story, the story of what it takes for our people to remain free. Our Water Story is not concluded; it is not history. Instead, the Water Story is a living story, and continues to be written by all Singaporeans today, whether in producing it or conserving it. Sometimes, it is in the larger things, in PUB continuously investing for water supply and their unceasingly effort to discover new technologies. Sometimes, it is the smaller things, like when we use a mug to brush our teeth or when the coffee-shop downstairs installs automated cup washing machines that use less water. These are all stories that make our Water Story. Mdm Chair, I hand over now to Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor to address our other strategies to make Singapore a sustainable and liveable home.'), ('Amy Khor Lean Suan', 'Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources', 'MSE', 'Thank you. Mdm Chair, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said: \"After Independence, I searched for some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries. I settled for a clean and green Singapore\". Thus, Mr Lee, together with the pioneer generation of Singaporeans, embarked on an unprecedented journey to transform Singapore from a slum to a Garden City. Today, as we work towards further enhancing Singapore\\'s liveability, we too need to think and act boldly on matter relating to the environment as Mr Lee did. All the more so, as we face huge challenges, such as manpower constraints, an ageing population and acute land scarcity. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Miss Cheng Li Hui raised relevant points on waste management. Let me first outline my Ministry\\'s overall strategy and priorities in managing waste. There are three key waste streams of greatest concern to us. The first is electrical and electronic waste, or e-waste for short. As Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Louis Ng have highlighted, about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste are generated annually. Currently, consumers can participate in e-waste recycling programmes which industry stakeholders voluntarily provide. For example, StarHub provides e-waste recycling bins at almost 280 convenient locations, such as shopping malls and community centres, through its RENEW programme. The e-waste collected is sent to recyclers such as Tes-Amm, where resources such as copper, aluminium and gold are extracted for reuse. We are currently consulting industry stakeholders on an enhanced national e-waste management system, which would cover both the collection and disposal of e-waste. Some countries, such as Germany and South Korea, have implemented similar systems. We will take into account our local context, such as product coverage and the physical and financial responsibilities of key stakeholders when developing the system. More details will be released later this year. Mr Ng spoke about HCFCs. Singapore is a party to the Montreal Protocol, and will phase out the use of HCFCs by 2030. We have put in place measures to help us achieve this, such as controls on the import of HCFCs for local use. Apart from regulatory control, we encourage the recycling of refrigerants recovered from refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Local recycling facilities such as Vemac Services Pte Ltd recover refrigerants from decommissioned industrial and commercial systems. We will monitor developments in this area, and assess the feasibility of implementing a management framework for HCFCs, taking into consideration the risk to human health, technical limitations, and the potential compliance costs which businesses would have to bear. The second concern is packaging waste, which makes up around one-third of our domestic waste. Since the launch of our voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement in 2007, we have achieved a cumulative reduction of more than 32,000 tonnes of packaging waste, but more can be done. We are exploring possible regulations for businesses, such as mandatory reporting of packaging placed on the local market and the submission of packaging waste reduction plans, over the next two to four years. We will study the issues and announce the details when ready. The third concern is food waste, which Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Miss Cheng have raised. My Ministry has been pursuing several initiatives on this front. We are encouraging more on-site food waste initiatives in individual entities, such as hotels, shopping malls, educational institutions and hawker centres. Mr Liang asked for an update on the district-level food waste treatment pilot in Clementi. Since the end of last year, source-segregated food waste from nine sites including schools, army camps and a food court has been transported to a demonstration facility in the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant. About three tonnes of food waste are collected daily, but we aim to increase this to 15 tonnes a day. If successful, this process will allow us to recover energy from food waste more efficiently. Good practices start from young and our schools have always been an enthusiastic partner in our recycling efforts. As part of these efforts, we will be launching food waste digesters in 10 schools in the second quarter this year. Under the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), we have set an overall recycling target of 70% by 2030. Over the last few years, our overall recycling rate has been around 60%. The non-domestic sector comprising industries and commercial premises have achieved a recycling rate of 77%. However, our domestic recycling rates have stagnated at around 20% in recent years. More needs to be done to put recycling at the heart of our culture. Referring to Assoc Prof Faishal and Miss Cheng\\'s queries, we will be reshaping the infrastructure of our physical environment to make recycling more convenient for households. We hope this will bring us closer to our domestic recycling rate of 30% by 2030. Since January 2014, all new HDB Build-to-Order (BTO) flats have installed recycling chutes adjacent to centralised refuse chutes at every level. Studies have shown that households living in apartments with dual chute systems recycle up to three times more than those in apartments which do not have such facilities. We are now ready to widen the adoption of such systems. The provision of recycling chutes will be extended to private residential developments. Buildings taller than four storeys in all new non-landed private residential developments will be required to install dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. Regarding Miss Cheng\\'s query on plans to reduce contamination rates of recyclables, education remains key. Through continued public education programmes in schools and at grassroots events, we encourage everyone to practise responsible recycling habits and ensure that only items which are suitable for recycling are deposited in the recycling bins and recycling chutes. As Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Miss Cheng have observed, our current methods of manual waste collection in the older flats are manpower-intensive and unsustainable. Moving forward, we will transform our waste collection system into a more efficient, manpower-light one. The Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) is an automated system which transports waste by air suction through a network of pipes to a central collection station. This reduces our reliance on manpower to collect refuse. The whole system will be enclosed, and residents will enjoy a more liveable environment, with a reduction in pest nuisance, odours and exposed waste. There is increasing adoption of PWCS in Singapore. In the public sector, HDB piloted the PWCS at Yuhua estate in Jurong under the HDB Greenprint Programme and will be installing PWCS in new HDB areas, such as Tampines North and Bidadari. Private developers, such as City Developments Limited and CapitaLand, have done likewise. To date, more than 100 condominium developments, such as the Palette at Pasir Ris and Sky Habitat at Bishan, have installed the PWCS. Therefore, to improve the efficiency and hygiene of waste collection, all new non-landed private residential developments with at least 500 dwelling units will need to be installed with PWCS. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. We have consulted extensively with industry players, including the Real Estate Developers\\' Association of Singapore (REDAS), and have taken their feedback into account in determining the threshold limits and the implementation date. We will also work closely with managing agents and community partners to educate residents on the correct use of the PWCS. To reap greater economies of scale, my Ministry is studying the feasibility of implementing PWCS at the district level, where different developments can be connected to the same network. An automated and enclosed network of district-level PWCS will bring us even closer to our vision of a manpower-efficient waste collection system in a liveable environment. Next, I turn to smoking. As Mr Ng highlighted, our long-term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public spaces except at designated areas. Last year, we extended smoking prohibition to areas around reservoirs, and more than 400 parks. With this, more than 32,000 premises are now smoke-free in Singapore. We will look into progressively extending the smoking prohibition in other areas. We recently set up five Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs) in Orchard Road to study the effectiveness of DSAs in reducing smoking in a commercial area. We hope this will encourage smokers to be considerate by smoking only at the DSAs. This study, when completed at the end of the year, will inform us on the public\\'s reception towards DSAs, and give us insight into the location and design considerations of DSAs. We will take into consideration the results of this study before we consider extending the implementation of DSAs to other locations. On public cleanliness, we have stepped up enforcement against littering. NEA issued more than 31,000 tickets to litterbugs last year. This is almost 18% more than 2015 and the highest since 2009. To Mr Gan Thiam Poh\\'s question about the effectiveness of CWOs, over the past five years, less than 6% of litterbugs who have undergone CWOs have been caught for littering again. Mr Gan also asked about the effectiveness of cameras against high-rise littering. NEA adopted the use of surveillance cameras in August 2012 and has since made more than 4,100 deployments and taken more than 3,300 enforcement actions against high-rise litterbugs. These cameras create an effective deterrent effect, as only about 1% of high-rise litterbugs are caught offending again. But beyond enforcement, the most effective and sustainable way to have a litter-free environment is to inculcate the right social values, so that the responsibility for keeping Singapore clean and caring for our environment is part of everyone\\'s DNA. Madam, our hawker centres are a unique and integral part of Singapore\\'s identity. Not only do they serve an important function of providing affordable food in a clean environment, they are key social spaces where people from all walks of life can enjoy a meal together. The Government had previously announced that 20 new hawker centres will be ready by 2027. This will add about 800 more cooked food stalls across the island. I am pleased to update that three new hawker centres have been completed so far, with the latest being at Our Tampines Hub, which commenced operations in November last year. As highlighted by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, NEA has been exploring alternative management models by engaging socially-conscious operators, such as NTUC Foodfare, Fei Siong and OTMH, as managing agents for our hawker centres. The feedback from both hawkers and patrons of these centres have been largely positive. NFC, in particular, is an established socially-conscious operator and has been managing the existing Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre since 2014. Rentals at these centres have remained unchanged and food prices have been kept largely stable. Besides monitoring food prices for affordability and ensuring that any price revision is justified, these operators have put in place initiatives like offering bulk purchase of ingredients to help hawkers reduce their cost, or putting in place productivity measures, such as centralised dish washing, to help hawkers address their manpower constraints. Given the encouraging outcomes of these initial efforts, we have extended this approach to other hawker centres. We have appointed NFC to manage a group of five existing centres with incumbent stallholders and two new centres. Allowing NFC to manage a bundle of hawker centres will enable them to have the necessary scale to enhance the vibrancy and hygiene standards across more hawker centres, as well as the flexibility to experiment with new ideas and processes, to benefit patrons and hawkers. This is the first expanded pilot and we would need to evaluate the results of this approach before we decide on the next steps. We are calling for tenders for the two new centres at Yishun and Jurong West. The tenders are open to all socially-conscious operators who are interested to manage the centres. We will select the best tender proposal to ensure that our hawker centres continue to fulfil the fundamental objective of providing affordable food in a hygienic environment while allowing our hawkers to make a decent livelihood. To Assoc Prof Daniel Goh\\'s query on subsidised rent in new centres, subsidised rents were offered to encourage street hawkers to relocate to hawker centres in the 1970s and early 1980s. Some hawkers were also allowed to operate stalls at subsidised rents under the previous hardship scheme, which was discontinued in 1990. Since then, all new hawkers are required to pay rental at market rate. Hence, there are no subsidised rents in all our new centres. Last year, I announced the formation of a Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee to review and make recommendations to improve the management of hawker centres and ensure the sustainability of the hawker trade to benefit Singaporeans. Following a year of extensive consultations with many stakeholders, including hawkers, patrons, cleaning service providers and members of the public, the Committee submitted the recommendations to the Minister in February this year. Mr Liang asked about the response to the Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee\\'s recommendations. I am pleased to announce that the Ministry has accepted all the recommendations. We will, therefore, work together with relevant stakeholders to implement them. Let me highlight a few plans that we will put in place in the coming months. First, one key recommendation is for the Government to provide training opportunities and pathways for aspiring hawkers − young or the not-so-young. For a start, we are working with the People\\'s Association to develop a \"Hawker Fare\" series of culinary classes, starting in May. Members of the public can learn how to cook hawker dishes, like chicken rice, yong tau foo and mee goreng from the veteran hawkers themselves. While not all trainees will eventually become hawkers, such courses will also help to generate interest in hawker food and culture among Singaporeans, and contribute to sustaining the hawker trade in the long run. There are a handful of culinary certification courses in the market today. However, these courses are largely not tailored for the hawker trade. Hence, in addition to the Hawker Fare series that focuses on culinary skills, we are working with ITE to develop a separate short course to teach aspiring hawkers relevant business management skills, like basic profit and loss analysis and how to tender for a stall, to help them set up and manage a hawker business. More details will be released later in the year. We welcome other interested parties, such as training providers, to work with us to provide appropriate training to aspiring hawkers. In the second half of this year, we will set up a one-stop information and service centre, which will provide useful information to both existing and aspiring hawkers, like how to tender for a stall, where to go for courses on food hygiene and the hawker trade, and the range of kitchen automation equipment available. During the second half of the year, we will also be launching an incubation stall programme, where some hawker stalls at several hawker centres will be pre-fitted by NEA to let eligible aspiring hawkers try out being a hawker for a period of, say, six months. This will allow them to decide if they are cut out for the trade without putting in heavy investments. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to say a few words in Mandarin. The Committee\\'s second recommendation focuses on improving productivity of the hawker centres. The Committee recommended that the Government implement productivity measures in the hawker centres to help hawkers reduce their workload and address the manpower challenges that hawkers are facing. In fact, productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing and cashless payment, are already a requirement in the new hawker centres. Some stallholders in existing centres have also voluntarily subscribed to centralised dishwashing services, such as those at Boon Lay Place Market and Food Centre. The Government will set aside $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives, which will help lighten the workload of hawkers and address manpower constraints. This will include some funding to increase the adoption of centre-level productivity initiatives, like centralised dish-washing and stall-level productivity initiatives like the purchase of kitchen automation equipment. We recognise that hawkers are concerned about the cost of productivity initiatives. Hence, as noted earlier, to alleviate these cost concerns, the Government will set aside about $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives in hawker centres. The funding will support the progressive reconfiguration of up to 25 existing centres over the next few years to facilitate the rolling out of centre-level productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing integrated with tray return, and cashless payment solutions similar to those seen at the hawker centre in Our Tampines Hub or Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. We will also co-fund up to 70% of the operating cost of such initiatives for hawkers in these centres for a period of time. This will help lower the initial cost of adoption of productivity measures that will help realise manpower and cost savings in the long term. To promote stall-level productivity, we will set up a Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant to co-fund the purchase of suitable kitchen automation equipment for cooked food stallholders. Each stallholder can claim 80% of the qualifying cost of the equipment on a reimbursement basis, up to a total of $5,000 within three years. Hawkers can start applying for this grant in the third quarter of this year. Some hawkers are already using kitchen automation equipment. When I visited Smith Street Food Centre recently, I came across a cooked food stallholder who sells steamed yam cakes. She uses an automated stirrer to mix ingredients which reduces a lot of manual labour. Through the Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant, we hope to encourage a greater adoption of such labour-saving equipment. Third, more than just dining spaces, hawker centres are places where Singaporeans of all walks of life can interact. In response to the Committee\\'s recommendation to encourage regular organised activities at hawker centres in a sustainable manner, I am happy to announce that we will be providing funding support of $2,000 per event to adopters of hawker centres, up to an annual cap of $10,000 for each adopter, to organise events to enhance the vibrancy of hawker centres. Such events can enhance patrons\\' dining experience at hawker centres, while increasing footfall and benefitting hawkers. Fourth, on graciousness in hawker centres, people recognise that the act of tray-return is a kind and considerate behaviour to be cultivated. To Mr Png Eng Huat\\'s question, we introduced tray-return to hawker centres in 2012 and since 2015, tray-return facilities have been implemented in all hawker centres. The tray-return rates vary, with the highest tray-return rates at Tiong Bahru Market, Blk 157 Tampines Street 11 and Our Tampines Hub. We have also been working on making tray-return stations more visible, prominent and accessible, as seen in the newer hawker centres. To study how to further improve tray return rates, we are also currently running a pilot involving the use of specially designed tray decals and working with our cleaning contractor at Zion Riverside Food Centre to train the cleaners to encourage patrons to clear their trays after their meals. These initiatives that we are rolling out are part of our efforts to ensure the sustainability and viability of the hawker trade. They should help to support both existing and aspiring hawkers. This in turn will allow Singaporeans to continue enjoying affordable food in a clean and hygienic environment. Lastly, let me give an update on our dengue cases. Despite earlier concerns that warmer weather would contribute to a spike in dengue cases to beyond 30,000 last year, we managed to bring the situation under control. There were instead 13,000 dengue cases last year. The World Health Organization has also commended our efforts in managing the Zika outbreak. However, we cannot be complacent, and should remain vigilant by doing the five-step Mozzie Wipeout. Mr Gan asked for an update on the small-scale field studies of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes that commenced last year. We have seen encouraging results so far. About half of the Aedes aegypti eggs collected from a trial site were unable to hatch. Our panel of international experts recently affirmed the good progress and expressed their support of NEA\\'s plan to move to the next phase of the suppression trial later this year. Mdm Chair, in conclusion, everyone must take responsibility for the environment. To achieve the vision of a liveable and sustainable Singapore, as laid out in our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, everyone needs to be part of the solution. The little things that we do, like throwing away our trash properly, recycling our waste responsibly and returning our trays with the crockery properly, can make a big difference. With the support of this House, Singaporeans can rise up and do this together.')]</td>\n",

       "0  Mdm Chair, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy intensity − the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) − improved by 1.8% in 2015. This surpassed the 1.5% gain seen in 2014, and triples the annual rate of 0.6% seen in the previous decade, according to IEA Energy Efficiency Market Report for 2016. But the report added that and I quote: \"However, global progress on energy intensity is still too slow, falling short of putting the world onto a sustainable pathway toward a decarbonised energy system. IEA analysis shows that annual energy intensity improvements need to rise immediately to at least 2.6% in a trajectory consistent with our climate goals.\" I would like to ask the Minister how is our performance in industrial energy efficiency efforts compared with other countries? What is the feedback from industries on the obstacles they are facing and what can the Ministry do to address these concerns? How are we to fulfil our commitment to the Paris Agreement? Are there any new plans to improve on our industrial energy efficiency? Our city state has done well in managing the air quality from vehicle emission. Unlike the days before year 2000, certainly we hardly see smoky vehicles on our roads, except some from across the causeway. Even the public can report to NEA if they see any smoky vehicles on our road. NEA requires periodic checks for buses and diesel vehicles and we strive to reduce domestic emissions to meet the 2020 air quality targets benchmarked against WHO standards. We have been successful and there are lessons to be learnt from what is happening in China, India and France where smoke from vehicle emission had created havoc on the ambient air quality. The toll can be very serious as we can see how the haze impacted the health of the people. WHO has pointed out that air pollution pose one of the biggest environmental health risks, especially for heart diseases. Can the Minister update the House on what is the strategy to achieve these targets and what has been done so far to improve the air quality in Singapore? Diesel vehicles are found to be the major culprit in polluting the air. In December 2016, four of the world's largest and most polluted cities have decided to ban diesel cars and trucks from their streets by 2025. Diesel engines emit particulates into the air at ground level, as well as emit nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides can help form ground-level ozone, which can lead to breathing difficulties for those suffering from respiratory problems. According to WHO, seven million deaths every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. At the last COS debate, we were told that a study on diesel vehicles would be undertaken by SUTD. I understand that it has recently submitted a report on alternative technologies to the Ministry. Can the Minister share with the House the outcome of this study? What next after this? There are some older commercial vehicles retained by their owners which do not meet current day emission standards. What are the Ministry's plans to address these old commercial vehicles? Will the ETS be extended? Apart from this, what are plans to curb emission from petrol cars and motorcycles? Next, I would like to briefly point out that there is much that can be done to improve the waste collection system. Frequently, we can see cleaners manually hauling refuse to the bin centres from the chutes at the HDB blocks. This gives rise to complaints from residents about the odour and the spread of pests when this exercise is not done properly. Are there any plans for the Ministry to improve on this waste disposal by cleaners? I note that the cost of water supply has risen over the years and the Government is raising prices by 30% in two phases from this July. I think what we need to do is to share with Singaporeans what the Government is doing to meet future demand and make our country resilient against any supply disruption especially in the current uncertain weather conditions? This would I feel at least make the people understand and appreciate the big picture behind the price increase. While on climate change, I would like to ask the Minister what are PUB's plans to cope with the unpredictable and intense rainfall that we may encounter in this age of weather turbulence. I know there were drainage works carried out to alleviate flooding, but as the past months have shown, there are many pockets in our midst where more work is required. I hope the Minister can update the House on the work done so far on the Stamford Diversion Canal, Stamford Detention Tank, and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. Has any of these been completed, and if so how have they helped to prevent flooding in key areas? On PUB, I would like to ask if the Minister can update us on the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme which was launched a decade ago. Where are we now? What more can we expect of ABC Waters for this financial year? Recently, the NEA has designated smoking areas in busy downtown Orchard Road. I do not know if this is after taking a cue from Nee Soon South, where we have successfully put up 42 Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) and eight more in progress; a total of 50 DSPs. I hope the Orchard Road experience is positive. May I ask what plans are there to further expand this to other parts of Singapore, and protect the public from inhaling second-hand cigarette smoke?   \n",

Are there other measures that we can put in place to incentivise the individual firms to be prudent and compel them to use alternative sources of energy? With this tax, are we on track to meeting our commitment to lower carbon emission? Has the Ministry explored other initiatives considering the level of carbon emitted in our day-to-day life may have compounded the problem? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider further reviewing the following. One, creating greater awareness of the importance of addressing climate change and its implication on Singapore and its people. This can be done through schools, at workplaces and in public places with educational posters and documentary films. Extensively promoting these recycling, reducing or replacing the usage of plastics. This can be done by providing greater access and incentives for one to exchange empty bottles for coins − a practice found in Sweden. Pushing for consumers to bring their recyclable bags and not providing the alternative of plastic carrier bags could also be considered. It is the age old culture that we need to reignite. About 19% of carbon emission comes from transportation. Can we do more in getting electric vehicles instead of petroleum cars to ply our roads if our effort to make Singaporeans switch to public transport remains a challenge? Can we better incentivise companies and individuals to encourage such efforts? The food we eat is what we are and what the environmental impact will be. It is important to educate Singaporeans on food that poses negative impact on the environment. \"The biggest intervention people could make towards reducing their carbon footprints is to eat significantly less red meat,\" said Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds. A research, led by scientists at the Oxford Martin School, found that shifting to a mostly vegetarian diet, or even simply cutting down meat consumption to within accepted health guidelines, would make a large dent in greenhouse gases. Adhering to health guidelines on meat consumption could cut global food-related emissions by nearly a third by 2050, while widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet would bring down emissions by 63%.

       "0  [('Masagos Zulkifli Bin Masagos Mohamad', 'Minister for the Environment and Water Resources', 'MSE', 'The environment has been at the top of our minds this Budget. I thank everyone who has spoken about the need to protect our resources for future generations. Singapore is not alone. Many other countries are paying closer attention to the environment, even as they grow their economies. We have a plan called the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB). This plan brings together all that we are doing, in pursuit of a Liveable and Endearing Home, a Vibrant and Sustainable City, and an Active and Gracious Community. I am glad to say that we have made progress over the course of 2016, and remain on track to meet the SSB targets progressively by 2030. A strong commitment to sustainability remains critical as we build our future economy. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms K Thanaletchimi have highlighted, it will take not only Government support but also the collective effort of every individual to realise this SSB vision. That is why we launched the Sustainable Singapore Movement in July last year to galvanise the community to action. Climate change. While we stand on solid footing, the road ahead is uncertain. A major concern for us is climate change, a far-reaching threat that we can already see and feel today. Our Meteorological Service recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1929, when we started keeping temperature records. In recent years, our water managers, too, have had a foretaste of the looming challenge of coping with extended dry spells on the one hand and higher intensity rainfall on the other. Singapore has to plan ahead to deal with climate change impacts. We will not only need to protect our buildings, coasts and infrastructure, but also foster greater awareness, so that we are a resilient people. As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore is committed to fulfilling our pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Both households and industry play a role in this, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh has noted. Industry, however, contributes the lion\\'s share − 60% − of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions. We, therefore, need to focus our efforts here. The upcoming carbon tax to be imposed on large emitters, as announced by the Minister for Finance, will help send the right price signal to industries to reduce their emissions when and where it makes the most business sense. The carbon tax, however, is not a panacea for achieving our 2030 emissions pledge. We will need other measures to complement the tax. That is why we introduced the Energy Conservation Act (ECA) in 2013, to put in place measures, such as mandatory energy management, and encourage companies to enhance their energy efficiency. I am pleased to report that we have made progress on this front since then. Let me give an example. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to show some slides please. Murata Electronics Singapore, which manufactures electronic components, is becoming an early adopter of efficient motors. Murata is replacing 50 motors with higher efficiency ones. This will save Murata some 160 MWh of electricity each year. These annual savings of $21,000 in energy costs will last throughout the 15-year lifespan of the motors. Murata is a good example of how industrial energy efficiency measures can benefit the environment as well as the company\\'s bottom line, but, for the industry sector as a whole, there is clearly more to be done. Data collected shows that our companies achieved an annual energy efficiency improvement rate of 0.6% in 2015, a slight improvement over 0.4% in 2014. This is still low. To meet our 2030 pledge, we need to work towards the 1% to 2% improvement rates achieved by leading countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands. On a positive note, companies that I spoke to at a recent consultation session recognised the importance of improving their energy efficiency. They, however, mentioned that they faced operational and capability constraints. Some also asked for best practices and useful data to be shared with them. We are studying their feedback and, for a start, we will amend the Energy Conservation Act to introduce a new set of initiatives to help companies improve their energy efficiency. First, all ECA-registered companies will now be required to implement structured energy management systems and conduct regular energy efficiency opportunity assessments. Second, companies expanding their facilities will need to factor energy efficiency into their designs upfront, as well as measure and report energy usage for key energy-consuming systems. Third, NEA\\'s data shows that a substantial proportion of common industrial equipment is inefficient. Hence, Minimum Energy Performance Standards will be introduced, first, for motors, and then other systems and equipment progressively. These practices are in line with that of leading jurisdictions and will help companies to adopt more efficient equipment, conserve energy and enjoy life cycle cost savings. To pave the way for a robust carbon tax regime, we need to have a sound Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. The ECA will thus be amended to require larger industrial emitters to improve the quality of measurement and reporting processes for their greenhouse gas emissions. This will help companies to better understand and manage their emissions. My Ministry will continue to work closely with the NCCS and MTI to consult the affected companies on how to best achieve this. We have also received feedback on the need to improve the current incentive schemes. NEA will be consolidating their existing energy efficiency incentive schemes into a single fund called the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F). NEA will redesign the E2F to better support companies to identify and undertake energy efficiency retrofits. We will, especially help our SMEs by co-funding up to 30% of their investments in energy efficient technologies. Further details will be released by NEA. We need a sustainable way to grow our economy. It is even more important if the world becomes increasingly carbon-constrained. Mdm Chair, let me move onto another key priority of the SSB: ensuring good air quality, which Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and other Members have spoken about. Indeed, just this week, the World Health Organization reported that worldwide, more than 0.5 million children die every year, due to air pollution. Over the years, we have taken steps to improve Singapore\\'s air quality, all to safeguard the health of our population. Measures include tightening industrial emission standards, updating emission standards for new vehicles and introducing schemes to turn over older, more polluting vehicles. Just last year, we tightened the emission standards for new motorcycles to the latest Euro 4 standards. These measures have made a difference. NEA\\'s studies show that the amount of pollutants emitted by vehicles have fallen by between 20% and 35%, over the last decade. However, we have still some way to go to meet our SSB targets. I announced last year that my Ministry would conduct a review on the diesel vehicle landscape, given rising global concerns over the health and environmental impact of diesel emissions. Diesel vehicles are a major source of local air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Studies have found that PM can penetrate the lungs and contribute to heart attacks, strokes and even dementia; while NOx becomes ground level ozone, which can result in respiratory problems. It is not surprising that many cities around the world have taken drastic steps to limit diesel vehicles within their city centres. Given these concerns, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Chia Shi-Lu have asked for an update on our progress. As part of our review, we commissioned Asst Prof Lynette Cheah from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) to study the impact of diesel vehicles and the availability of alternative technologies. The study found that there are indeed cleaner alternatives for certain classes of vehicles. At the same time, we recognise these alternatives also have limitations and may require infrastructure that is not widely available today. Nevertheless, my Ministry will explore ways with other agencies to encourage the adoption of viable alternatives to diesel vehicles. The volumetric diesel duty, which the Minister for Finance introduced two weeks ago, is in line with our plans. A usage-based tax better accounts for the harmful effects of each litre of diesel fuel used. We hope that this will encourage individuals and companies to optimise their use of diesel fuel, and even switch to alternative technologies with lower emissions. Apart from this, we will continue with our three-pronged approach in managing vehicular emissions. Firstly, we encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles, such as low emission hybrid cars, which Mr Louis Ng spoke about. The Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) was first designed to nudge consumers towards vehicles with lower carbon emissions. This remains important as vehicles contribute the second largest share of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions after-industries. However, we now need to revise CEVS to include tailpipe emissions of harmful air pollutants on top of carbon dioxide. The revised CEVS will be renamed as the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES). To incentivise the purchase of car and taxi models which are more environmentally friendly overall, the VES rebate or surcharge will be determined by the worst performing pollutant. This incentive framework has worked well in the past, and we will continue to review its effectiveness. Secondly, we inspect vehicles already on the road to minimise harmful emissions from them. The in-use emission standard for diesel vehicles was already tightened in January 2014. We will now introduce new in-use emission standards for petrol vehicles and motorcycles, similar to those already in place in Europe and Japan. These standards are designed to be easily met by properly maintained vehicles. The new standards will take effect on 1 April 2018, and will help minimise excessive emissions due to vehicle defects or poor maintenance. Thirdly, we encourage the removal of older and more polluting vehicles. To incentivise this, we will revise the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS). The ETS has been successful with over 27,000 older diesel vehicles being replaced by newer ones, resulting in significant reductions in NOx and PM. We will extend the scheme for Euro II and III diesel commercial vehicles that turn over to Euro 6 and equivalent models, for two years from August 2017. Given industry feedback, as well as the findings that Light Goods Vehicles (LGVs) remain a major contributor of diesel pollution due to their large population, the scheme will also be enhanced by increasing the COE bonus for LGVs from 13% to 35%. We hope that through this, more diesel commercial vehicles and buses will switch to Euro 6 models or cleaner electric hybrids or petrol alternatives. Transboundary haze − as a small city-state, clean air is not just a local issue. Forest and peatland fires in the region can produce haze which affects us. Transboundary haze is not only detrimental to the social and economic well-being of Southeast Asian nations, it represents a major setback to the global effort to fight climate change. A scientific study has shown that the 2015 fires in Indonesia released nearly 1 gigaton of greenhouse gases. Daily emissions during that haze period were even higher than that of the entire European Union. Fortunately, the relatively wet Southwest Monsoon season in 2016 and active efforts by the Indonesian government have prevented a repeat of the 2015 haze. However, as we approach the next dry season, we appreciate the recent commitment by the Indonesian government to take action to prevent fires. In fact, as we speak, the Riau Province is under emergency alert for potential fires. It is important that we continue to send a strong deterrent message to errant companies responsible for these fires, that they must change their ways. That is why we enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014. We will continue to take all steps necessary to enforce the THPA, while ensuring that we operate within the ambit of international law. Businesses and the general public can play their part too. Large companies should especially ensure that sustainable practices extend throughout their entire supply chain. I am glad that last year, WWF-Singapore, together with Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, launched the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil. This alliance aims to transform the palm oil industry by increasing the availability and usage of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) in the region. At the same time, the Singapore Environment Council has enhanced the criteria for the Singapore Green Label for pulp and paper products to take into account the companies\\' efforts to prevent fires on their plantations and manage their plantations on peatland. With the enhanced label, consumers will be better able to identify paper companies with sustainable business practices and make their choices accordingly. As Mr Louis Ng has pointed out, regional cooperation remains essential to tackle the haze problem. Last year, ASEAN member states came together to develop the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control. This is a laudable development and underscores the region\\'s commitment to realise the vision of a Haze-free ASEAN by 2020. We all look forward to the completion of the ASEAN study on the social, health and economic impacts of the 2015 haze crisis, which will consolidate the case for the ASEAN member states to strengthen efforts to prevent the recurrence of haze. Mdm Chair, I have laid out our plans to secure clean energy and clean air. Now let me turn to clean water. Firstly, I appreciate all who have given their comments on the water price revision over the past week and during the COS, and the many Ministers who have responded. I would like to revisit our water story. To do this, let me begin with \"the tale of two countries\" − the Netherlands and Singapore. Both our countries face acute water problems. However, the Dutch have a different problem from us − that of too much water. They have plenty of water from rivers, and much of the country lies below sea level and is prone to flooding. The massive flood of 1953 in which thousands perished is etched in their national memory. A few months ago, I visited the small town of Zuidplas, the lowest point of Netherlands and all of Europe. Members can see the man standing there, below the marker which says 7.8m below sea level? This marker shows that people in Zuidplas live 7.8m below sea level and actually are hardly aware of it. Even so, people all over Netherlands are always reminded that the rivers could overflow anytime, inundating their homes and destroying their livelihoods. Thus, to adapt, the Dutch over time built a complex system of dykes, pumps and water storage capabilities across the country. This was possible because each household contributed its share of water taxes, establishing the world\\'s first and only water bank which could finance large investments. In fact, this bank was instrumental in the recovery and the aftermath of the 1953 floods. Today, the Dutch continues to pour over EUR$400 million into flood protection each year. Climate change threatens catastrophes if they do not. This capability has turned into a great advantage. They have attracted water intensive industries to invest and their expertise is exported globally. Even Singapore is now learning how to construct a polder at Pulau Tekong with their help. We know that the Singapore Story is at the other extreme. We do not have enough water. But we must take the same determined approach as the Dutch. We have strived relentlessly to secure reliable and good quality water supply through innovation, sound management and a national awareness of our unique situation. Our strategy involves not just long-term planning, but also right-pricing, and water conservation measures. All these levers work in tandem. Let me touch on planning. Planning and investing in water resources ahead of time is in our DNA. This is even more critical in the face of looming challenges of climate change to water security, and this applies around the world. We have only to look at Linggiu Reservoir, which is about a third full now, and can dry up if current abstractions continue and prolonged dry weather returns, unpredicted. It has always worried us because a dry Linggiu Reservoir will be disastrous for both Singapore and Johor in many ways. The Dutch will recall they did not pay heed to the 1928 and 1934 studies, which repeatedly warned that their dykes were inadequate. Even when high water in 1943 reached the dykes, only simple repairs were made, because they were distracted even after World War II was over. The fact is nobody felt like spending a vast amount of money on raising the dykes. After all, there were no floods for years. So when the storm surge of 1953 happened, water broke through the dykes and claimed 1,800 lives. For us, because we were adequately prepared in 2014, the prolonged dry weather in Singapore did not cost us dearly. But low rainfall continued to take a toll on Linggiu in 2015 and 2016, leaving it at its lowest level of 20% in October 2016. For PUB, it is always about ensuring resilience in our water supply so that disruptions do not occur to our businesses and no Singaporeans will die of thirst. How have we done this? Last year, PUB completed its latest review of the Water Master Plan, a strategic blueprint for our water till 2060. The plan provides for development of NEWater and desalination plants to meet up to 85% of our water demand by 2060, as well as new pipelines for drinking water and used water. We are making good progress on the plans. Singapore\\'s fifth NEWater plant, located at Changi, officially opened in January this year. The third desalination plant in Tuas will be completed this year, and the fourth and fifth desalination plants in Marina East and Jurong Island are underway. Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), which includes the new water reclamation plant at Tuas, is on track for completion by 2025. All these have now become critical so that we have a resilient water supply when the water does not favour us. The Dutch has taken a leaf from the lesson of history and likewise planned ahead and built storm barriers, one of which is the largest moving structures on earth, to defend against exceptional storm surges and the new climate predictions. We also need to maintain and upgrade our existing water assets, as the Dutch has done with the dykes. As our infrastructure ages, PUB will accelerate renewal plans to minimise pipe leaks and supply interruptions. Our unaccounted-for-water losses, which include leaks from our supply network, are around 5%. This is among the lowest worldwide. In London, leakage is about one-fifth of water demand. We cannot afford that. It equates to losing all the water produced by two or three desalination plants. That brings me to water conservation, another key lever in our system, which Mr Gan spoke about. My Ministry and PUB have a suite of measures, in addition to right-pricing, to promote greater water savings for households and businesses. In 2016, households used 148 litres of water per capita per day, down significantly from a decade ago. We still have some way to go to reach our SSB target of 140 litres by 2030, not to mention trying to achieve even lowest levels as seen in cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. If each of us can save 10 litres of water per day, that is almost half a desalination plant. Over the past weeks, I have been inspired by the many stories of people who have gone the extra mile to conserve water. Some save the rinsed water discharged from washing machines for toilet flushing, while others used the water from washing rice to water their plants. HDB residents are now used to having their corridors washed every four weeks rather than two weeks. This is the right spirit. We should do more together. To help water saving initiatives, PUB will introduce several new measures. As part of our plans to phase out less water efficient products, PUB will raise the minimum standards to two-tick rating for sales, supply and installation of water fittings from April 2019. PUB will also extend labelling requirements to dishwashers from October 2018. PUB will also introduce two new water conservation programmes for households. First, PUB will roll out a community project for lower income households to replace their existing nine-litre water closets with more efficient ones. This can help them save up to 10% in their monthly water bills. Second, PUB will be installing smart shower devices for 10,000 new homes as a demonstration project. The smart shower device provides real-time information on water consumption during showers. An earlier small scale study found that a person could save up to five litres a day using these devices. If the positive effects are validated in the demonstration project, PUB may roll out the devices to even more households. As for businesses, we will continue to work with them to optimise water use. For large users, PUB has since 2015 required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP), which help companies better understand to manage their water consumption. At a recent consultation, some companies, including SSMC, a wafer fabrication facility, said that they invest in water saving measures as a matter of principle, even though water formed only a small part of their costs. I am heartened that, for these companies, they are driven as much by water conservation DNA as company profit and loss (P&L). I hope many more businesses follow suit. Let me now turn to drainage. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah pointed out, climate change will pose challenges to flood management as well. PUB will continue with its island-wide programme to rehabilitate and upgrade our drains to higher design standards. This year, we will start work at another 27 locations. The Stamford Detention Tank will be ready this year, while the Stamford Diversion Canal and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal will be completed in 2018. These works, when ready, will enhance flood protection for the catchments. Our water bodies are critical assets, but we have to make them accessible. Just over a decade ago, we launched the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, to allow Singaporeans to own and enjoy our water resources. I am pleased to share that 34 ABC Waters projects have been opened to the community to date. This year, we can expect the opening of four new ABC Waters projects across the island, including Pang Sua Pond and Siglap Canal, which should be opened later this month. Another four projects at Sungei Tampines (Tampines Ave 7 to TPE), Chestnut Drive Outlet Drain, Sungei Simpang Kanan and Alexandra Sub-drain A will commence construction this year. I hope this serves, as a constant reminder of our precious asset. Mdm Chair, I have touched on our approach to water to ensure that we do not have too little and to help us manage when there is too much. Many of us are familiar with the Singapore Water Story. Perhaps there is a risk of over-familiarity, a certain jadedness from one too many Social Studies lesson. Just like water flowing from taps everywhere, it can become invisible, overlooked, undervalued, just like the people in Zuidplas who are not aware that they live 7.8 metres below sea level. This month, we celebrate World Water Day, to highlight the importance of water sustainability. It is a timely reminder that even today, 663 million people around the world do not have access to clean water. It is in this context that we should relive, and encounter afresh our Water Story, the story of what it takes for our people to remain free. Our Water Story is not concluded; it is not history. Instead, the Water Story is a living story, and continues to be written by all Singaporeans today, whether in producing it or conserving it. Sometimes, it is in the larger things, in PUB continuously investing for water supply and their unceasingly effort to discover new technologies. Sometimes, it is the smaller things, like when we use a mug to brush our teeth or when the coffee-shop downstairs installs automated cup washing machines that use less water. These are all stories that make our Water Story. Mdm Chair, I hand over now to Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor to address our other strategies to make Singapore a sustainable and liveable home.'), ('Amy Khor Lean Suan', 'Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources', 'MSE', 'Thank you. Mdm Chair, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said: \"After Independence, I searched for some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries. I settled for a clean and green Singapore\". Thus, Mr Lee, together with the pioneer generation of Singaporeans, embarked on an unprecedented journey to transform Singapore from a slum to a Garden City. Today, as we work towards further enhancing Singapore\\'s liveability, we too need to think and act boldly on matter relating to the environment as Mr Lee did. All the more so, as we face huge challenges, such as manpower constraints, an ageing population and acute land scarcity. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Miss Cheng Li Hui raised relevant points on waste management. Let me first outline my Ministry\\'s overall strategy and priorities in managing waste. There are three key waste streams of greatest concern to us. The first is electrical and electronic waste, or e-waste for short. As Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Louis Ng have highlighted, about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste are generated annually. Currently, consumers can participate in e-waste recycling programmes which industry stakeholders voluntarily provide. For example, StarHub provides e-waste recycling bins at almost 280 convenient locations, such as shopping malls and community centres, through its RENEW programme. The e-waste collected is sent to recyclers such as Tes-Amm, where resources such as copper, aluminium and gold are extracted for reuse. We are currently consulting industry stakeholders on an enhanced national e-waste management system, which would cover both the collection and disposal of e-waste. Some countries, such as Germany and South Korea, have implemented similar systems. We will take into account our local context, such as product coverage and the physical and financial responsibilities of key stakeholders when developing the system. More details will be released later this year. Mr Ng spoke about HCFCs. Singapore is a party to the Montreal Protocol, and will phase out the use of HCFCs by 2030. We have put in place measures to help us achieve this, such as controls on the import of HCFCs for local use. Apart from regulatory control, we encourage the recycling of refrigerants recovered from refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Local recycling facilities such as Vemac Services Pte Ltd recover refrigerants from decommissioned industrial and commercial systems. We will monitor developments in this area, and assess the feasibility of implementing a management framework for HCFCs, taking into consideration the risk to human health, technical limitations, and the potential compliance costs which businesses would have to bear. The second concern is packaging waste, which makes up around one-third of our domestic waste. Since the launch of our voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement in 2007, we have achieved a cumulative reduction of more than 32,000 tonnes of packaging waste, but more can be done. We are exploring possible regulations for businesses, such as mandatory reporting of packaging placed on the local market and the submission of packaging waste reduction plans, over the next two to four years. We will study the issues and announce the details when ready. The third concern is food waste, which Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Miss Cheng have raised. My Ministry has been pursuing several initiatives on this front. We are encouraging more on-site food waste initiatives in individual entities, such as hotels, shopping malls, educational institutions and hawker centres. Mr Liang asked for an update on the district-level food waste treatment pilot in Clementi. Since the end of last year, source-segregated food waste from nine sites including schools, army camps and a food court has been transported to a demonstration facility in the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant. About three tonnes of food waste are collected daily, but we aim to increase this to 15 tonnes a day. If successful, this process will allow us to recover energy from food waste more efficiently. Good practices start from young and our schools have always been an enthusiastic partner in our recycling efforts. As part of these efforts, we will be launching food waste digesters in 10 schools in the second quarter this year. Under the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), we have set an overall recycling target of 70% by 2030. Over the last few years, our overall recycling rate has been around 60%. The non-domestic sector comprising industries and commercial premises have achieved a recycling rate of 77%. However, our domestic recycling rates have stagnated at around 20% in recent years. More needs to be done to put recycling at the heart of our culture. Referring to Assoc Prof Faishal and Miss Cheng\\'s queries, we will be reshaping the infrastructure of our physical environment to make recycling more convenient for households. We hope this will bring us closer to our domestic recycling rate of 30% by 2030. Since January 2014, all new HDB Build-to-Order (BTO) flats have installed recycling chutes adjacent to centralised refuse chutes at every level. Studies have shown that households living in apartments with dual chute systems recycle up to three times more than those in apartments which do not have such facilities. We are now ready to widen the adoption of such systems. The provision of recycling chutes will be extended to private residential developments. Buildings taller than four storeys in all new non-landed private residential developments will be required to install dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. Regarding Miss Cheng\\'s query on plans to reduce contamination rates of recyclables, education remains key. Through continued public education programmes in schools and at grassroots events, we encourage everyone to practise responsible recycling habits and ensure that only items which are suitable for recycling are deposited in the recycling bins and recycling chutes. As Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Miss Cheng have observed, our current methods of manual waste collection in the older flats are manpower-intensive and unsustainable. Moving forward, we will transform our waste collection system into a more efficient, manpower-light one. The Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) is an automated system which transports waste by air suction through a network of pipes to a central collection station. This reduces our reliance on manpower to collect refuse. The whole system will be enclosed, and residents will enjoy a more liveable environment, with a reduction in pest nuisance, odours and exposed waste. There is increasing adoption of PWCS in Singapore. In the public sector, HDB piloted the PWCS at Yuhua estate in Jurong under the HDB Greenprint Programme and will be installing PWCS in new HDB areas, such as Tampines North and Bidadari. Private developers, such as City Developments Limited and CapitaLand, have done likewise. To date, more than 100 condominium developments, such as the Palette at Pasir Ris and Sky Habitat at Bishan, have installed the PWCS. Therefore, to improve the efficiency and hygiene of waste collection, all new non-landed private residential developments with at least 500 dwelling units will need to be installed with PWCS. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. We have consulted extensively with industry players, including the Real Estate Developers\\' Association of Singapore (REDAS), and have taken their feedback into account in determining the threshold limits and the implementation date. We will also work closely with managing agents and community partners to educate residents on the correct use of the PWCS. To reap greater economies of scale, my Ministry is studying the feasibility of implementing PWCS at the district level, where different developments can be connected to the same network. An automated and enclosed network of district-level PWCS will bring us even closer to our vision of a manpower-efficient waste collection system in a liveable environment. Next, I turn to smoking. As Mr Ng highlighted, our long-term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public spaces except at designated areas. Last year, we extended smoking prohibition to areas around reservoirs, and more than 400 parks. With this, more than 32,000 premises are now smoke-free in Singapore. We will look into progressively extending the smoking prohibition in other areas. We recently set up five Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs) in Orchard Road to study the effectiveness of DSAs in reducing smoking in a commercial area. We hope this will encourage smokers to be considerate by smoking only at the DSAs. This study, when completed at the end of the year, will inform us on the public\\'s reception towards DSAs, and give us insight into the location and design considerations of DSAs. We will take into consideration the results of this study before we consider extending the implementation of DSAs to other locations. On public cleanliness, we have stepped up enforcement against littering. NEA issued more than 31,000 tickets to litterbugs last year. This is almost 18% more than 2015 and the highest since 2009. To Mr Gan Thiam Poh\\'s question about the effectiveness of CWOs, over the past five years, less than 6% of litterbugs who have undergone CWOs have been caught for littering again. Mr Gan also asked about the effectiveness of cameras against high-rise littering. NEA adopted the use of surveillance cameras in August 2012 and has since made more than 4,100 deployments and taken more than 3,300 enforcement actions against high-rise litterbugs. These cameras create an effective deterrent effect, as only about 1% of high-rise litterbugs are caught offending again. But beyond enforcement, the most effective and sustainable way to have a litter-free environment is to inculcate the right social values, so that the responsibility for keeping Singapore clean and caring for our environment is part of everyone\\'s DNA. Madam, our hawker centres are a unique and integral part of Singapore\\'s identity. Not only do they serve an important function of providing affordable food in a clean environment, they are key social spaces where people from all walks of life can enjoy a meal together. The Government had previously announced that 20 new hawker centres will be ready by 2027. This will add about 800 more cooked food stalls across the island. I am pleased to update that three new hawker centres have been completed so far, with the latest being at Our Tampines Hub, which commenced operations in November last year. As highlighted by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, NEA has been exploring alternative management models by engaging socially-conscious operators, such as NTUC Foodfare, Fei Siong and OTMH, as managing agents for our hawker centres. The feedback from both hawkers and patrons of these centres have been largely positive. NFC, in particular, is an established socially-conscious operator and has been managing the existing Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre since 2014. Rentals at these centres have remained unchanged and food prices have been kept largely stable. Besides monitoring food prices for affordability and ensuring that any price revision is justified, these operators have put in place initiatives like offering bulk purchase of ingredients to help hawkers reduce their cost, or putting in place productivity measures, such as centralised dish washing, to help hawkers address their manpower constraints. Given the encouraging outcomes of these initial efforts, we have extended this approach to other hawker centres. We have appointed NFC to manage a group of five existing centres with incumbent stallholders and two new centres. Allowing NFC to manage a bundle of hawker centres will enable them to have the necessary scale to enhance the vibrancy and hygiene standards across more hawker centres, as well as the flexibility to experiment with new ideas and processes, to benefit patrons and hawkers. This is the first expanded pilot and we would need to evaluate the results of this approach before we decide on the next steps. We are calling for tenders for the two new centres at Yishun and Jurong West. The tenders are open to all socially-conscious operators who are interested to manage the centres. We will select the best tender proposal to ensure that our hawker centres continue to fulfil the fundamental objective of providing affordable food in a hygienic environment while allowing our hawkers to make a decent livelihood. To Assoc Prof Daniel Goh\\'s query on subsidised rent in new centres, subsidised rents were offered to encourage street hawkers to relocate to hawker centres in the 1970s and early 1980s. Some hawkers were also allowed to operate stalls at subsidised rents under the previous hardship scheme, which was discontinued in 1990. Since then, all new hawkers are required to pay rental at market rate. Hence, there are no subsidised rents in all our new centres. Last year, I announced the formation of a Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee to review and make recommendations to improve the management of hawker centres and ensure the sustainability of the hawker trade to benefit Singaporeans. Following a year of extensive consultations with many stakeholders, including hawkers, patrons, cleaning service providers and members of the public, the Committee submitted the recommendations to the Minister in February this year. Mr Liang asked about the response to the Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee\\'s recommendations. I am pleased to announce that the Ministry has accepted all the recommendations. We will, therefore, work together with relevant stakeholders to implement them. Let me highlight a few plans that we will put in place in the coming months. First, one key recommendation is for the Government to provide training opportunities and pathways for aspiring hawkers − young or the not-so-young. For a start, we are working with the People\\'s Association to develop a \"Hawker Fare\" series of culinary classes, starting in May. Members of the public can learn how to cook hawker dishes, like chicken rice, yong tau foo and mee goreng from the veteran hawkers themselves. While not all trainees will eventually become hawkers, such courses will also help to generate interest in hawker food and culture among Singaporeans, and contribute to sustaining the hawker trade in the long run. There are a handful of culinary certification courses in the market today. However, these courses are largely not tailored for the hawker trade. Hence, in addition to the Hawker Fare series that focuses on culinary skills, we are working with ITE to develop a separate short course to teach aspiring hawkers relevant business management skills, like basic profit and loss analysis and how to tender for a stall, to help them set up and manage a hawker business. More details will be released later in the year. We welcome other interested parties, such as training providers, to work with us to provide appropriate training to aspiring hawkers. In the second half of this year, we will set up a one-stop information and service centre, which will provide useful information to both existing and aspiring hawkers, like how to tender for a stall, where to go for courses on food hygiene and the hawker trade, and the range of kitchen automation equipment available. During the second half of the year, we will also be launching an incubation stall programme, where some hawker stalls at several hawker centres will be pre-fitted by NEA to let eligible aspiring hawkers try out being a hawker for a period of, say, six months. This will allow them to decide if they are cut out for the trade without putting in heavy investments. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to say a few words in Mandarin. The Committee\\'s second recommendation focuses on improving productivity of the hawker centres. The Committee recommended that the Government implement productivity measures in the hawker centres to help hawkers reduce their workload and address the manpower challenges that hawkers are facing. In fact, productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing and cashless payment, are already a requirement in the new hawker centres. Some stallholders in existing centres have also voluntarily subscribed to centralised dishwashing services, such as those at Boon Lay Place Market and Food Centre. The Government will set aside $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives, which will help lighten the workload of hawkers and address manpower constraints. This will include some funding to increase the adoption of centre-level productivity initiatives, like centralised dish-washing and stall-level productivity initiatives like the purchase of kitchen automation equipment. We recognise that hawkers are concerned about the cost of productivity initiatives. Hence, as noted earlier, to alleviate these cost concerns, the Government will set aside about $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives in hawker centres. The funding will support the progressive reconfiguration of up to 25 existing centres over the next few years to facilitate the rolling out of centre-level productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing integrated with tray return, and cashless payment solutions similar to those seen at the hawker centre in Our Tampines Hub or Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. We will also co-fund up to 70% of the operating cost of such initiatives for hawkers in these centres for a period of time. This will help lower the initial cost of adoption of productivity measures that will help realise manpower and cost savings in the long term. To promote stall-level productivity, we will set up a Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant to co-fund the purchase of suitable kitchen automation equipment for cooked food stallholders. Each stallholder can claim 80% of the qualifying cost of the equipment on a reimbursement basis, up to a total of $5,000 within three years. Hawkers can start applying for this grant in the third quarter of this year. Some hawkers are already using kitchen automation equipment. When I visited Smith Street Food Centre recently, I came across a cooked food stallholder who sells steamed yam cakes. She uses an automated stirrer to mix ingredients which reduces a lot of manual labour. Through the Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant, we hope to encourage a greater adoption of such labour-saving equipment. Third, more than just dining spaces, hawker centres are places where Singaporeans of all walks of life can interact. In response to the Committee\\'s recommendation to encourage regular organised activities at hawker centres in a sustainable manner, I am happy to announce that we will be providing funding support of $2,000 per event to adopters of hawker centres, up to an annual cap of $10,000 for each adopter, to organise events to enhance the vibrancy of hawker centres. Such events can enhance patrons\\' dining experience at hawker centres, while increasing footfall and benefitting hawkers. Fourth, on graciousness in hawker centres, people recognise that the act of tray-return is a kind and considerate behaviour to be cultivated. To Mr Png Eng Huat\\'s question, we introduced tray-return to hawker centres in 2012 and since 2015, tray-return facilities have been implemented in all hawker centres. The tray-return rates vary, with the highest tray-return rates at Tiong Bahru Market, Blk 157 Tampines Street 11 and Our Tampines Hub. We have also been working on making tray-return stations more visible, prominent and accessible, as seen in the newer hawker centres. To study how to further improve tray return rates, we are also currently running a pilot involving the use of specially designed tray decals and working with our cleaning contractor at Zion Riverside Food Centre to train the cleaners to encourage patrons to clear their trays after their meals. These initiatives that we are rolling out are part of our efforts to ensure the sustainability and viability of the hawker trade. They should help to support both existing and aspiring hawkers. This in turn will allow Singaporeans to continue enjoying affordable food in a clean and hygienic environment. Lastly, let me give an update on our dengue cases. Despite earlier concerns that warmer weather would contribute to a spike in dengue cases to beyond 30,000 last year, we managed to bring the situation under control. There were instead 13,000 dengue cases last year. The World Health Organization has also commended our efforts in managing the Zika outbreak. However, we cannot be complacent, and should remain vigilant by doing the five-step Mozzie Wipeout. Mr Gan asked for an update on the small-scale field studies of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes that commenced last year. We have seen encouraging results so far. About half of the Aedes aegypti eggs collected from a trial site were unable to hatch. Our panel of international experts recently affirmed the good progress and expressed their support of NEA\\'s plan to move to the next phase of the suppression trial later this year. Mdm Chair, in conclusion, everyone must take responsibility for the environment. To achieve the vision of a liveable and sustainable Singapore, as laid out in our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, everyone needs to be part of the solution. The little things that we do, like throwing away our trash properly, recycling our waste responsibly and returning our trays with the crockery properly, can make a big difference. With the support of this House, Singaporeans can rise up and do this together.')]   \n",
       "1  [('Masagos Zulkifli Bin Masagos Mohamad', 'Minister for the Environment and Water Resources', 'MSE', 'The environment has been at the top of our minds this Budget. I thank everyone who has spoken about the need to protect our resources for future generations. Singapore is not alone. Many other countries are paying closer attention to the environment, even as they grow their economies. We have a plan called the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB). This plan brings together all that we are doing, in pursuit of a Liveable and Endearing Home, a Vibrant and Sustainable City, and an Active and Gracious Community. I am glad to say that we have made progress over the course of 2016, and remain on track to meet the SSB targets progressively by 2030. A strong commitment to sustainability remains critical as we build our future economy. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms K Thanaletchimi have highlighted, it will take not only Government support but also the collective effort of every individual to realise this SSB vision. That is why we launched the Sustainable Singapore Movement in July last year to galvanise the community to action. Climate change. While we stand on solid footing, the road ahead is uncertain. A major concern for us is climate change, a far-reaching threat that we can already see and feel today. Our Meteorological Service recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1929, when we started keeping temperature records. In recent years, our water managers, too, have had a foretaste of the looming challenge of coping with extended dry spells on the one hand and higher intensity rainfall on the other. Singapore has to plan ahead to deal with climate change impacts. We will not only need to protect our buildings, coasts and infrastructure, but also foster greater awareness, so that we are a resilient people. As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore is committed to fulfilling our pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Both households and industry play a role in this, as Mr Gan Thiam Poh has noted. Industry, however, contributes the lion\\'s share − 60% − of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions. We, therefore, need to focus our efforts here. The upcoming carbon tax to be imposed on large emitters, as announced by the Minister for Finance, will help send the right price signal to industries to reduce their emissions when and where it makes the most business sense. The carbon tax, however, is not a panacea for achieving our 2030 emissions pledge. We will need other measures to complement the tax. That is why we introduced the Energy Conservation Act (ECA) in 2013, to put in place measures, such as mandatory energy management, and encourage companies to enhance their energy efficiency. I am pleased to report that we have made progress on this front since then. Let me give an example. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to show some slides please. Murata Electronics Singapore, which manufactures electronic components, is becoming an early adopter of efficient motors. Murata is replacing 50 motors with higher efficiency ones. This will save Murata some 160 MWh of electricity each year. These annual savings of $21,000 in energy costs will last throughout the 15-year lifespan of the motors. Murata is a good example of how industrial energy efficiency measures can benefit the environment as well as the company\\'s bottom line, but, for the industry sector as a whole, there is clearly more to be done. Data collected shows that our companies achieved an annual energy efficiency improvement rate of 0.6% in 2015, a slight improvement over 0.4% in 2014. This is still low. To meet our 2030 pledge, we need to work towards the 1% to 2% improvement rates achieved by leading countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands. On a positive note, companies that I spoke to at a recent consultation session recognised the importance of improving their energy efficiency. They, however, mentioned that they faced operational and capability constraints. Some also asked for best practices and useful data to be shared with them. We are studying their feedback and, for a start, we will amend the Energy Conservation Act to introduce a new set of initiatives to help companies improve their energy efficiency. First, all ECA-registered companies will now be required to implement structured energy management systems and conduct regular energy efficiency opportunity assessments. Second, companies expanding their facilities will need to factor energy efficiency into their designs upfront, as well as measure and report energy usage for key energy-consuming systems. Third, NEA\\'s data shows that a substantial proportion of common industrial equipment is inefficient. Hence, Minimum Energy Performance Standards will be introduced, first, for motors, and then other systems and equipment progressively. These practices are in line with that of leading jurisdictions and will help companies to adopt more efficient equipment, conserve energy and enjoy life cycle cost savings. To pave the way for a robust carbon tax regime, we need to have a sound Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. The ECA will thus be amended to require larger industrial emitters to improve the quality of measurement and reporting processes for their greenhouse gas emissions. This will help companies to better understand and manage their emissions. My Ministry will continue to work closely with the NCCS and MTI to consult the affected companies on how to best achieve this. We have also received feedback on the need to improve the current incentive schemes. NEA will be consolidating their existing energy efficiency incentive schemes into a single fund called the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F). NEA will redesign the E2F to better support companies to identify and undertake energy efficiency retrofits. We will, especially help our SMEs by co-funding up to 30% of their investments in energy efficient technologies. Further details will be released by NEA. We need a sustainable way to grow our economy. It is even more important if the world becomes increasingly carbon-constrained. Mdm Chair, let me move onto another key priority of the SSB: ensuring good air quality, which Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and other Members have spoken about. Indeed, just this week, the World Health Organization reported that worldwide, more than 0.5 million children die every year, due to air pollution. Over the years, we have taken steps to improve Singapore\\'s air quality, all to safeguard the health of our population. Measures include tightening industrial emission standards, updating emission standards for new vehicles and introducing schemes to turn over older, more polluting vehicles. Just last year, we tightened the emission standards for new motorcycles to the latest Euro 4 standards. These measures have made a difference. NEA\\'s studies show that the amount of pollutants emitted by vehicles have fallen by between 20% and 35%, over the last decade. However, we have still some way to go to meet our SSB targets. I announced last year that my Ministry would conduct a review on the diesel vehicle landscape, given rising global concerns over the health and environmental impact of diesel emissions. Diesel vehicles are a major source of local air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Studies have found that PM can penetrate the lungs and contribute to heart attacks, strokes and even dementia; while NOx becomes ground level ozone, which can result in respiratory problems. It is not surprising that many cities around the world have taken drastic steps to limit diesel vehicles within their city centres. Given these concerns, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Chia Shi-Lu have asked for an update on our progress. As part of our review, we commissioned Asst Prof Lynette Cheah from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) to study the impact of diesel vehicles and the availability of alternative technologies. The study found that there are indeed cleaner alternatives for certain classes of vehicles. At the same time, we recognise these alternatives also have limitations and may require infrastructure that is not widely available today. Nevertheless, my Ministry will explore ways with other agencies to encourage the adoption of viable alternatives to diesel vehicles. The volumetric diesel duty, which the Minister for Finance introduced two weeks ago, is in line with our plans. A usage-based tax better accounts for the harmful effects of each litre of diesel fuel used. We hope that this will encourage individuals and companies to optimise their use of diesel fuel, and even switch to alternative technologies with lower emissions. Apart from this, we will continue with our three-pronged approach in managing vehicular emissions. Firstly, we encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles, such as low emission hybrid cars, which Mr Louis Ng spoke about. The Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) was first designed to nudge consumers towards vehicles with lower carbon emissions. This remains important as vehicles contribute the second largest share of Singapore\\'s greenhouse gas emissions after-industries. However, we now need to revise CEVS to include tailpipe emissions of harmful air pollutants on top of carbon dioxide. The revised CEVS will be renamed as the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES). To incentivise the purchase of car and taxi models which are more environmentally friendly overall, the VES rebate or surcharge will be determined by the worst performing pollutant. This incentive framework has worked well in the past, and we will continue to review its effectiveness. Secondly, we inspect vehicles already on the road to minimise harmful emissions from them. The in-use emission standard for diesel vehicles was already tightened in January 2014. We will now introduce new in-use emission standards for petrol vehicles and motorcycles, similar to those already in place in Europe and Japan. These standards are designed to be easily met by properly maintained vehicles. The new standards will take effect on 1 April 2018, and will help minimise excessive emissions due to vehicle defects or poor maintenance. Thirdly, we encourage the removal of older and more polluting vehicles. To incentivise this, we will revise the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS). The ETS has been successful with over 27,000 older diesel vehicles being replaced by newer ones, resulting in significant reductions in NOx and PM. We will extend the scheme for Euro II and III diesel commercial vehicles that turn over to Euro 6 and equivalent models, for two years from August 2017. Given industry feedback, as well as the findings that Light Goods Vehicles (LGVs) remain a major contributor of diesel pollution due to their large population, the scheme will also be enhanced by increasing the COE bonus for LGVs from 13% to 35%. We hope that through this, more diesel commercial vehicles and buses will switch to Euro 6 models or cleaner electric hybrids or petrol alternatives. Transboundary haze − as a small city-state, clean air is not just a local issue. Forest and peatland fires in the region can produce haze which affects us. Transboundary haze is not only detrimental to the social and economic well-being of Southeast Asian nations, it represents a major setback to the global effort to fight climate change. A scientific study has shown that the 2015 fires in Indonesia released nearly 1 gigaton of greenhouse gases. Daily emissions during that haze period were even higher than that of the entire European Union. Fortunately, the relatively wet Southwest Monsoon season in 2016 and active efforts by the Indonesian government have prevented a repeat of the 2015 haze. However, as we approach the next dry season, we appreciate the recent commitment by the Indonesian government to take action to prevent fires. In fact, as we speak, the Riau Province is under emergency alert for potential fires. It is important that we continue to send a strong deterrent message to errant companies responsible for these fires, that they must change their ways. That is why we enacted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) in 2014. We will continue to take all steps necessary to enforce the THPA, while ensuring that we operate within the ambit of international law. Businesses and the general public can play their part too. Large companies should especially ensure that sustainable practices extend throughout their entire supply chain. I am glad that last year, WWF-Singapore, together with Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, launched the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil. This alliance aims to transform the palm oil industry by increasing the availability and usage of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) in the region. At the same time, the Singapore Environment Council has enhanced the criteria for the Singapore Green Label for pulp and paper products to take into account the companies\\' efforts to prevent fires on their plantations and manage their plantations on peatland. With the enhanced label, consumers will be better able to identify paper companies with sustainable business practices and make their choices accordingly. As Mr Louis Ng has pointed out, regional cooperation remains essential to tackle the haze problem. Last year, ASEAN member states came together to develop the Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control. This is a laudable development and underscores the region\\'s commitment to realise the vision of a Haze-free ASEAN by 2020. We all look forward to the completion of the ASEAN study on the social, health and economic impacts of the 2015 haze crisis, which will consolidate the case for the ASEAN member states to strengthen efforts to prevent the recurrence of haze. Mdm Chair, I have laid out our plans to secure clean energy and clean air. Now let me turn to clean water. Firstly, I appreciate all who have given their comments on the water price revision over the past week and during the COS, and the many Ministers who have responded. I would like to revisit our water story. To do this, let me begin with \"the tale of two countries\" − the Netherlands and Singapore. Both our countries face acute water problems. However, the Dutch have a different problem from us − that of too much water. They have plenty of water from rivers, and much of the country lies below sea level and is prone to flooding. The massive flood of 1953 in which thousands perished is etched in their national memory. A few months ago, I visited the small town of Zuidplas, the lowest point of Netherlands and all of Europe. Members can see the man standing there, below the marker which says 7.8m below sea level? This marker shows that people in Zuidplas live 7.8m below sea level and actually are hardly aware of it. Even so, people all over Netherlands are always reminded that the rivers could overflow anytime, inundating their homes and destroying their livelihoods. Thus, to adapt, the Dutch over time built a complex system of dykes, pumps and water storage capabilities across the country. This was possible because each household contributed its share of water taxes, establishing the world\\'s first and only water bank which could finance large investments. In fact, this bank was instrumental in the recovery and the aftermath of the 1953 floods. Today, the Dutch continues to pour over EUR$400 million into flood protection each year. Climate change threatens catastrophes if they do not. This capability has turned into a great advantage. They have attracted water intensive industries to invest and their expertise is exported globally. Even Singapore is now learning how to construct a polder at Pulau Tekong with their help. We know that the Singapore Story is at the other extreme. We do not have enough water. But we must take the same determined approach as the Dutch. We have strived relentlessly to secure reliable and good quality water supply through innovation, sound management and a national awareness of our unique situation. Our strategy involves not just long-term planning, but also right-pricing, and water conservation measures. All these levers work in tandem. Let me touch on planning. Planning and investing in water resources ahead of time is in our DNA. This is even more critical in the face of looming challenges of climate change to water security, and this applies around the world. We have only to look at Linggiu Reservoir, which is about a third full now, and can dry up if current abstractions continue and prolonged dry weather returns, unpredicted. It has always worried us because a dry Linggiu Reservoir will be disastrous for both Singapore and Johor in many ways. The Dutch will recall they did not pay heed to the 1928 and 1934 studies, which repeatedly warned that their dykes were inadequate. Even when high water in 1943 reached the dykes, only simple repairs were made, because they were distracted even after World War II was over. The fact is nobody felt like spending a vast amount of money on raising the dykes. After all, there were no floods for years. So when the storm surge of 1953 happened, water broke through the dykes and claimed 1,800 lives. For us, because we were adequately prepared in 2014, the prolonged dry weather in Singapore did not cost us dearly. But low rainfall continued to take a toll on Linggiu in 2015 and 2016, leaving it at its lowest level of 20% in October 2016. For PUB, it is always about ensuring resilience in our water supply so that disruptions do not occur to our businesses and no Singaporeans will die of thirst. How have we done this? Last year, PUB completed its latest review of the Water Master Plan, a strategic blueprint for our water till 2060. The plan provides for development of NEWater and desalination plants to meet up to 85% of our water demand by 2060, as well as new pipelines for drinking water and used water. We are making good progress on the plans. Singapore\\'s fifth NEWater plant, located at Changi, officially opened in January this year. The third desalination plant in Tuas will be completed this year, and the fourth and fifth desalination plants in Marina East and Jurong Island are underway. Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), which includes the new water reclamation plant at Tuas, is on track for completion by 2025. All these have now become critical so that we have a resilient water supply when the water does not favour us. The Dutch has taken a leaf from the lesson of history and likewise planned ahead and built storm barriers, one of which is the largest moving structures on earth, to defend against exceptional storm surges and the new climate predictions. We also need to maintain and upgrade our existing water assets, as the Dutch has done with the dykes. As our infrastructure ages, PUB will accelerate renewal plans to minimise pipe leaks and supply interruptions. Our unaccounted-for-water losses, which include leaks from our supply network, are around 5%. This is among the lowest worldwide. In London, leakage is about one-fifth of water demand. We cannot afford that. It equates to losing all the water produced by two or three desalination plants. That brings me to water conservation, another key lever in our system, which Mr Gan spoke about. My Ministry and PUB have a suite of measures, in addition to right-pricing, to promote greater water savings for households and businesses. In 2016, households used 148 litres of water per capita per day, down significantly from a decade ago. We still have some way to go to reach our SSB target of 140 litres by 2030, not to mention trying to achieve even lowest levels as seen in cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. If each of us can save 10 litres of water per day, that is almost half a desalination plant. Over the past weeks, I have been inspired by the many stories of people who have gone the extra mile to conserve water. Some save the rinsed water discharged from washing machines for toilet flushing, while others used the water from washing rice to water their plants. HDB residents are now used to having their corridors washed every four weeks rather than two weeks. This is the right spirit. We should do more together. To help water saving initiatives, PUB will introduce several new measures. As part of our plans to phase out less water efficient products, PUB will raise the minimum standards to two-tick rating for sales, supply and installation of water fittings from April 2019. PUB will also extend labelling requirements to dishwashers from October 2018. PUB will also introduce two new water conservation programmes for households. First, PUB will roll out a community project for lower income households to replace their existing nine-litre water closets with more efficient ones. This can help them save up to 10% in their monthly water bills. Second, PUB will be installing smart shower devices for 10,000 new homes as a demonstration project. The smart shower device provides real-time information on water consumption during showers. An earlier small scale study found that a person could save up to five litres a day using these devices. If the positive effects are validated in the demonstration project, PUB may roll out the devices to even more households. As for businesses, we will continue to work with them to optimise water use. For large users, PUB has since 2015 required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP), which help companies better understand to manage their water consumption. At a recent consultation, some companies, including SSMC, a wafer fabrication facility, said that they invest in water saving measures as a matter of principle, even though water formed only a small part of their costs. I am heartened that, for these companies, they are driven as much by water conservation DNA as company profit and loss (P&L). I hope many more businesses follow suit. Let me now turn to drainage. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah pointed out, climate change will pose challenges to flood management as well. PUB will continue with its island-wide programme to rehabilitate and upgrade our drains to higher design standards. This year, we will start work at another 27 locations. The Stamford Detention Tank will be ready this year, while the Stamford Diversion Canal and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal will be completed in 2018. These works, when ready, will enhance flood protection for the catchments. Our water bodies are critical assets, but we have to make them accessible. Just over a decade ago, we launched the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, to allow Singaporeans to own and enjoy our water resources. I am pleased to share that 34 ABC Waters projects have been opened to the community to date. This year, we can expect the opening of four new ABC Waters projects across the island, including Pang Sua Pond and Siglap Canal, which should be opened later this month. Another four projects at Sungei Tampines (Tampines Ave 7 to TPE), Chestnut Drive Outlet Drain, Sungei Simpang Kanan and Alexandra Sub-drain A will commence construction this year. I hope this serves, as a constant reminder of our precious asset. Mdm Chair, I have touched on our approach to water to ensure that we do not have too little and to help us manage when there is too much. Many of us are familiar with the Singapore Water Story. Perhaps there is a risk of over-familiarity, a certain jadedness from one too many Social Studies lesson. Just like water flowing from taps everywhere, it can become invisible, overlooked, undervalued, just like the people in Zuidplas who are not aware that they live 7.8 metres below sea level. This month, we celebrate World Water Day, to highlight the importance of water sustainability. It is a timely reminder that even today, 663 million people around the world do not have access to clean water. It is in this context that we should relive, and encounter afresh our Water Story, the story of what it takes for our people to remain free. Our Water Story is not concluded; it is not history. Instead, the Water Story is a living story, and continues to be written by all Singaporeans today, whether in producing it or conserving it. Sometimes, it is in the larger things, in PUB continuously investing for water supply and their unceasingly effort to discover new technologies. Sometimes, it is the smaller things, like when we use a mug to brush our teeth or when the coffee-shop downstairs installs automated cup washing machines that use less water. These are all stories that make our Water Story. Mdm Chair, I hand over now to Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor to address our other strategies to make Singapore a sustainable and liveable home.'), ('Amy Khor Lean Suan', 'Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources', 'MSE', 'Thank you. Mdm Chair, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said: \"After Independence, I searched for some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries. I settled for a clean and green Singapore\". Thus, Mr Lee, together with the pioneer generation of Singaporeans, embarked on an unprecedented journey to transform Singapore from a slum to a Garden City. Today, as we work towards further enhancing Singapore\\'s liveability, we too need to think and act boldly on matter relating to the environment as Mr Lee did. All the more so, as we face huge challenges, such as manpower constraints, an ageing population and acute land scarcity. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Miss Cheng Li Hui raised relevant points on waste management. Let me first outline my Ministry\\'s overall strategy and priorities in managing waste. There are three key waste streams of greatest concern to us. The first is electrical and electronic waste, or e-waste for short. As Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Louis Ng have highlighted, about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste are generated annually. Currently, consumers can participate in e-waste recycling programmes which industry stakeholders voluntarily provide. For example, StarHub provides e-waste recycling bins at almost 280 convenient locations, such as shopping malls and community centres, through its RENEW programme. The e-waste collected is sent to recyclers such as Tes-Amm, where resources such as copper, aluminium and gold are extracted for reuse. We are currently consulting industry stakeholders on an enhanced national e-waste management system, which would cover both the collection and disposal of e-waste. Some countries, such as Germany and South Korea, have implemented similar systems. We will take into account our local context, such as product coverage and the physical and financial responsibilities of key stakeholders when developing the system. More details will be released later this year. Mr Ng spoke about HCFCs. Singapore is a party to the Montreal Protocol, and will phase out the use of HCFCs by 2030. We have put in place measures to help us achieve this, such as controls on the import of HCFCs for local use. Apart from regulatory control, we encourage the recycling of refrigerants recovered from refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Local recycling facilities such as Vemac Services Pte Ltd recover refrigerants from decommissioned industrial and commercial systems. We will monitor developments in this area, and assess the feasibility of implementing a management framework for HCFCs, taking into consideration the risk to human health, technical limitations, and the potential compliance costs which businesses would have to bear. The second concern is packaging waste, which makes up around one-third of our domestic waste. Since the launch of our voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement in 2007, we have achieved a cumulative reduction of more than 32,000 tonnes of packaging waste, but more can be done. We are exploring possible regulations for businesses, such as mandatory reporting of packaging placed on the local market and the submission of packaging waste reduction plans, over the next two to four years. We will study the issues and announce the details when ready. The third concern is food waste, which Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Miss Cheng have raised. My Ministry has been pursuing several initiatives on this front. We are encouraging more on-site food waste initiatives in individual entities, such as hotels, shopping malls, educational institutions and hawker centres. Mr Liang asked for an update on the district-level food waste treatment pilot in Clementi. Since the end of last year, source-segregated food waste from nine sites including schools, army camps and a food court has been transported to a demonstration facility in the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant. About three tonnes of food waste are collected daily, but we aim to increase this to 15 tonnes a day. If successful, this process will allow us to recover energy from food waste more efficiently. Good practices start from young and our schools have always been an enthusiastic partner in our recycling efforts. As part of these efforts, we will be launching food waste digesters in 10 schools in the second quarter this year. Under the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), we have set an overall recycling target of 70% by 2030. Over the last few years, our overall recycling rate has been around 60%. The non-domestic sector comprising industries and commercial premises have achieved a recycling rate of 77%. However, our domestic recycling rates have stagnated at around 20% in recent years. More needs to be done to put recycling at the heart of our culture. Referring to Assoc Prof Faishal and Miss Cheng\\'s queries, we will be reshaping the infrastructure of our physical environment to make recycling more convenient for households. We hope this will bring us closer to our domestic recycling rate of 30% by 2030. Since January 2014, all new HDB Build-to-Order (BTO) flats have installed recycling chutes adjacent to centralised refuse chutes at every level. Studies have shown that households living in apartments with dual chute systems recycle up to three times more than those in apartments which do not have such facilities. We are now ready to widen the adoption of such systems. The provision of recycling chutes will be extended to private residential developments. Buildings taller than four storeys in all new non-landed private residential developments will be required to install dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. Regarding Miss Cheng\\'s query on plans to reduce contamination rates of recyclables, education remains key. Through continued public education programmes in schools and at grassroots events, we encourage everyone to practise responsible recycling habits and ensure that only items which are suitable for recycling are deposited in the recycling bins and recycling chutes. As Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Miss Cheng have observed, our current methods of manual waste collection in the older flats are manpower-intensive and unsustainable. Moving forward, we will transform our waste collection system into a more efficient, manpower-light one. The Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) is an automated system which transports waste by air suction through a network of pipes to a central collection station. This reduces our reliance on manpower to collect refuse. The whole system will be enclosed, and residents will enjoy a more liveable environment, with a reduction in pest nuisance, odours and exposed waste. There is increasing adoption of PWCS in Singapore. In the public sector, HDB piloted the PWCS at Yuhua estate in Jurong under the HDB Greenprint Programme and will be installing PWCS in new HDB areas, such as Tampines North and Bidadari. Private developers, such as City Developments Limited and CapitaLand, have done likewise. To date, more than 100 condominium developments, such as the Palette at Pasir Ris and Sky Habitat at Bishan, have installed the PWCS. Therefore, to improve the efficiency and hygiene of waste collection, all new non-landed private residential developments with at least 500 dwelling units will need to be installed with PWCS. This measure will apply to all new non-landed residential development applications submitted from 1 April 2018. We have consulted extensively with industry players, including the Real Estate Developers\\' Association of Singapore (REDAS), and have taken their feedback into account in determining the threshold limits and the implementation date. We will also work closely with managing agents and community partners to educate residents on the correct use of the PWCS. To reap greater economies of scale, my Ministry is studying the feasibility of implementing PWCS at the district level, where different developments can be connected to the same network. An automated and enclosed network of district-level PWCS will bring us even closer to our vision of a manpower-efficient waste collection system in a liveable environment. Next, I turn to smoking. As Mr Ng highlighted, our long-term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public spaces except at designated areas. Last year, we extended smoking prohibition to areas around reservoirs, and more than 400 parks. With this, more than 32,000 premises are now smoke-free in Singapore. We will look into progressively extending the smoking prohibition in other areas. We recently set up five Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs) in Orchard Road to study the effectiveness of DSAs in reducing smoking in a commercial area. We hope this will encourage smokers to be considerate by smoking only at the DSAs. This study, when completed at the end of the year, will inform us on the public\\'s reception towards DSAs, and give us insight into the location and design considerations of DSAs. We will take into consideration the results of this study before we consider extending the implementation of DSAs to other locations. On public cleanliness, we have stepped up enforcement against littering. NEA issued more than 31,000 tickets to litterbugs last year. This is almost 18% more than 2015 and the highest since 2009. To Mr Gan Thiam Poh\\'s question about the effectiveness of CWOs, over the past five years, less than 6% of litterbugs who have undergone CWOs have been caught for littering again. Mr Gan also asked about the effectiveness of cameras against high-rise littering. NEA adopted the use of surveillance cameras in August 2012 and has since made more than 4,100 deployments and taken more than 3,300 enforcement actions against high-rise litterbugs. These cameras create an effective deterrent effect, as only about 1% of high-rise litterbugs are caught offending again. But beyond enforcement, the most effective and sustainable way to have a litter-free environment is to inculcate the right social values, so that the responsibility for keeping Singapore clean and caring for our environment is part of everyone\\'s DNA. Madam, our hawker centres are a unique and integral part of Singapore\\'s identity. Not only do they serve an important function of providing affordable food in a clean environment, they are key social spaces where people from all walks of life can enjoy a meal together. The Government had previously announced that 20 new hawker centres will be ready by 2027. This will add about 800 more cooked food stalls across the island. I am pleased to update that three new hawker centres have been completed so far, with the latest being at Our Tampines Hub, which commenced operations in November last year. As highlighted by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, NEA has been exploring alternative management models by engaging socially-conscious operators, such as NTUC Foodfare, Fei Siong and OTMH, as managing agents for our hawker centres. The feedback from both hawkers and patrons of these centres have been largely positive. NFC, in particular, is an established socially-conscious operator and has been managing the existing Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre since 2014. Rentals at these centres have remained unchanged and food prices have been kept largely stable. Besides monitoring food prices for affordability and ensuring that any price revision is justified, these operators have put in place initiatives like offering bulk purchase of ingredients to help hawkers reduce their cost, or putting in place productivity measures, such as centralised dish washing, to help hawkers address their manpower constraints. Given the encouraging outcomes of these initial efforts, we have extended this approach to other hawker centres. We have appointed NFC to manage a group of five existing centres with incumbent stallholders and two new centres. Allowing NFC to manage a bundle of hawker centres will enable them to have the necessary scale to enhance the vibrancy and hygiene standards across more hawker centres, as well as the flexibility to experiment with new ideas and processes, to benefit patrons and hawkers. This is the first expanded pilot and we would need to evaluate the results of this approach before we decide on the next steps. We are calling for tenders for the two new centres at Yishun and Jurong West. The tenders are open to all socially-conscious operators who are interested to manage the centres. We will select the best tender proposal to ensure that our hawker centres continue to fulfil the fundamental objective of providing affordable food in a hygienic environment while allowing our hawkers to make a decent livelihood. To Assoc Prof Daniel Goh\\'s query on subsidised rent in new centres, subsidised rents were offered to encourage street hawkers to relocate to hawker centres in the 1970s and early 1980s. Some hawkers were also allowed to operate stalls at subsidised rents under the previous hardship scheme, which was discontinued in 1990. Since then, all new hawkers are required to pay rental at market rate. Hence, there are no subsidised rents in all our new centres. Last year, I announced the formation of a Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee to review and make recommendations to improve the management of hawker centres and ensure the sustainability of the hawker trade to benefit Singaporeans. Following a year of extensive consultations with many stakeholders, including hawkers, patrons, cleaning service providers and members of the public, the Committee submitted the recommendations to the Minister in February this year. Mr Liang asked about the response to the Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee\\'s recommendations. I am pleased to announce that the Ministry has accepted all the recommendations. We will, therefore, work together with relevant stakeholders to implement them. Let me highlight a few plans that we will put in place in the coming months. First, one key recommendation is for the Government to provide training opportunities and pathways for aspiring hawkers − young or the not-so-young. For a start, we are working with the People\\'s Association to develop a \"Hawker Fare\" series of culinary classes, starting in May. Members of the public can learn how to cook hawker dishes, like chicken rice, yong tau foo and mee goreng from the veteran hawkers themselves. While not all trainees will eventually become hawkers, such courses will also help to generate interest in hawker food and culture among Singaporeans, and contribute to sustaining the hawker trade in the long run. There are a handful of culinary certification courses in the market today. However, these courses are largely not tailored for the hawker trade. Hence, in addition to the Hawker Fare series that focuses on culinary skills, we are working with ITE to develop a separate short course to teach aspiring hawkers relevant business management skills, like basic profit and loss analysis and how to tender for a stall, to help them set up and manage a hawker business. More details will be released later in the year. We welcome other interested parties, such as training providers, to work with us to provide appropriate training to aspiring hawkers. In the second half of this year, we will set up a one-stop information and service centre, which will provide useful information to both existing and aspiring hawkers, like how to tender for a stall, where to go for courses on food hygiene and the hawker trade, and the range of kitchen automation equipment available. During the second half of the year, we will also be launching an incubation stall programme, where some hawker stalls at several hawker centres will be pre-fitted by NEA to let eligible aspiring hawkers try out being a hawker for a period of, say, six months. This will allow them to decide if they are cut out for the trade without putting in heavy investments. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to say a few words in Mandarin. The Committee\\'s second recommendation focuses on improving productivity of the hawker centres. The Committee recommended that the Government implement productivity measures in the hawker centres to help hawkers reduce their workload and address the manpower challenges that hawkers are facing. In fact, productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing and cashless payment, are already a requirement in the new hawker centres. Some stallholders in existing centres have also voluntarily subscribed to centralised dishwashing services, such as those at Boon Lay Place Market and Food Centre. The Government will set aside $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives, which will help lighten the workload of hawkers and address manpower constraints. This will include some funding to increase the adoption of centre-level productivity initiatives, like centralised dish-washing and stall-level productivity initiatives like the purchase of kitchen automation equipment. We recognise that hawkers are concerned about the cost of productivity initiatives. Hence, as noted earlier, to alleviate these cost concerns, the Government will set aside about $90 million to facilitate the adoption of productivity initiatives in hawker centres. The funding will support the progressive reconfiguration of up to 25 existing centres over the next few years to facilitate the rolling out of centre-level productivity initiatives, such as centralised dishwashing integrated with tray return, and cashless payment solutions similar to those seen at the hawker centre in Our Tampines Hub or Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. We will also co-fund up to 70% of the operating cost of such initiatives for hawkers in these centres for a period of time. This will help lower the initial cost of adoption of productivity measures that will help realise manpower and cost savings in the long term. To promote stall-level productivity, we will set up a Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant to co-fund the purchase of suitable kitchen automation equipment for cooked food stallholders. Each stallholder can claim 80% of the qualifying cost of the equipment on a reimbursement basis, up to a total of $5,000 within three years. Hawkers can start applying for this grant in the third quarter of this year. Some hawkers are already using kitchen automation equipment. When I visited Smith Street Food Centre recently, I came across a cooked food stallholder who sells steamed yam cakes. She uses an automated stirrer to mix ingredients which reduces a lot of manual labour. Through the Hawkers\\' Productivity Grant, we hope to encourage a greater adoption of such labour-saving equipment. Third, more than just dining spaces, hawker centres are places where Singaporeans of all walks of life can interact. In response to the Committee\\'s recommendation to encourage regular organised activities at hawker centres in a sustainable manner, I am happy to announce that we will be providing funding support of $2,000 per event to adopters of hawker centres, up to an annual cap of $10,000 for each adopter, to organise events to enhance the vibrancy of hawker centres. Such events can enhance patrons\\' dining experience at hawker centres, while increasing footfall and benefitting hawkers. Fourth, on graciousness in hawker centres, people recognise that the act of tray-return is a kind and considerate behaviour to be cultivated. To Mr Png Eng Huat\\'s question, we introduced tray-return to hawker centres in 2012 and since 2015, tray-return facilities have been implemented in all hawker centres. The tray-return rates vary, with the highest tray-return rates at Tiong Bahru Market, Blk 157 Tampines Street 11 and Our Tampines Hub. We have also been working on making tray-return stations more visible, prominent and accessible, as seen in the newer hawker centres. To study how to further improve tray return rates, we are also currently running a pilot involving the use of specially designed tray decals and working with our cleaning contractor at Zion Riverside Food Centre to train the cleaners to encourage patrons to clear their trays after their meals. These initiatives that we are rolling out are part of our efforts to ensure the sustainability and viability of the hawker trade. They should help to support both existing and aspiring hawkers. This in turn will allow Singaporeans to continue enjoying affordable food in a clean and hygienic environment. Lastly, let me give an update on our dengue cases. Despite earlier concerns that warmer weather would contribute to a spike in dengue cases to beyond 30,000 last year, we managed to bring the situation under control. There were instead 13,000 dengue cases last year. The World Health Organization has also commended our efforts in managing the Zika outbreak. However, we cannot be complacent, and should remain vigilant by doing the five-step Mozzie Wipeout. Mr Gan asked for an update on the small-scale field studies of Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes that commenced last year. We have seen encouraging results so far. About half of the Aedes aegypti eggs collected from a trial site were unable to hatch. Our panel of international experts recently affirmed the good progress and expressed their support of NEA\\'s plan to move to the next phase of the suppression trial later this year. Mdm Chair, in conclusion, everyone must take responsibility for the environment. To achieve the vision of a liveable and sustainable Singapore, as laid out in our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, everyone needs to be part of the solution. The little things that we do, like throwing away our trash properly, recycling our waste responsibly and returning our trays with the crockery properly, can make a big difference. With the support of this House, Singaporeans can rise up and do this together.')]   \n",

       "      <td>Mdm Chair, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy intensity − the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) − improved by 1.8% in 2015. This surpassed the 1.5% gain seen in 2014, and triples the annual rate of 0.6% seen in the previous decade, according to IEA Energy Efficiency Market Report for 2016. But the report added that and I quote: \"However, global progress on energy intensity is still too slow, falling short of putting the world onto a sustainable pathway toward a decarbonised energy system. IEA analysis shows that annual energy intensity improvements need to rise immediately to at least 2.6% in a trajectory consistent with our climate goals.\" I would like to ask the Minister how is our performance in industrial energy efficiency efforts compared with other countries? What is the feedback from industries on the obstacles they are facing and what can the Ministry do to address these concerns? How are we to fulfil our commitment to the Paris Agreement? Are there any new plans to improve on our industrial energy efficiency? Our city state has done well in managing the air quality from vehicle emission. Unlike the days before year 2000, certainly we hardly see smoky vehicles on our roads, except some from across the causeway. Even the public can report to NEA if they see any smoky vehicles on our road. NEA requires periodic checks for buses and diesel vehicles and we strive to reduce domestic emissions to meet the 2020 air quality targets benchmarked against WHO standards. We have been successful and there are lessons to be learnt from what is happening in China, India and France where smoke from vehicle emission had created havoc on the ambient air quality. The toll can be very serious as we can see how the haze impacted the health of the people. WHO has pointed out that air pollution pose one of the biggest environmental health risks, especially for heart diseases. Can the Minister update the House on what is the strategy to achieve these targets and what has been done so far to improve the air quality in Singapore? Diesel vehicles are found to be the major culprit in polluting the air. In December 2016, four of the world's largest and most polluted cities have decided to ban diesel cars and trucks from their streets by 2025. Diesel engines emit particulates into the air at ground level, as well as emit nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides can help form ground-level ozone, which can lead to breathing difficulties for those suffering from respiratory problems. According to WHO, seven million deaths every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. At the last COS debate, we were told that a study on diesel vehicles would be undertaken by SUTD. I understand that it has recently submitted a report on alternative technologies to the Ministry. Can the Minister share with the House the outcome of this study? What next after this? There are some older commercial vehicles retained by their owners which do not meet current day emission standards. What are the Ministry's plans to address these old commercial vehicles? Will the ETS be extended? Apart from this, what are plans to curb emission from petrol cars and motorcycles? Next, I would like to briefly point out that there is much that can be done to improve the waste collection system. Frequently, we can see cleaners manually hauling refuse to the bin centres from the chutes at the HDB blocks. This gives rise to complaints from residents about the odour and the spread of pests when this exercise is not done properly. Are there any plans for the Ministry to improve on this waste disposal by cleaners? I note that the cost of water supply has risen over the years and the Government is raising prices by 30% in two phases from this July. I think what we need to do is to share with Singaporeans what the Government is doing to meet future demand and make our country resilient against any supply disruption especially in the current uncertain weather conditions? This would I feel at least make the people understand and appreciate the big picture behind the price increase. While on climate change, I would like to ask the Minister what are PUB's plans to cope with the unpredictable and intense rainfall that we may encounter in this age of weather turbulence. I know there were drainage works carried out to alleviate flooding, but as the past months have shown, there are many pockets in our midst where more work is required. I hope the Minister can update the House on the work done so far on the Stamford Diversion Canal, Stamford Detention Tank, and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. Has any of these been completed, and if so how have they helped to prevent flooding in key areas? On PUB, I would like to ask if the Minister can update us on the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme which was launched a decade ago. Where are we now? What more can we expect of ABC Waters for this financial year? Recently, the NEA has designated smoking areas in busy downtown Orchard Road. I do not know if this is after taking a cue from Nee Soon South, where we have successfully put up 42 Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) and eight more in progress; a total of 50 DSPs. I hope the Orchard Road experience is positive. May I ask what plans are there to further expand this to other parts of Singapore, and protect the public from inhaling second-hand cigarette smoke?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Madam, regarding the recent announcement on carbon tax, though it is in the right direction to reduce carbon emission, it will, however, have an impact on the industries financial sustainability and ultimately the workers and consumers. Are there other measures that we can put in place to incentivise the individual firms to be prudent and compel them to use alternative sources of energy? With this tax, are we on track to meeting our commitment to lower carbon emission? Has the Ministry explored other initiatives considering the level of carbon emitted in our day-to-day life may have compounded the problem? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider further reviewing the following. One, creating greater awareness of the importance of addressing climate change and its implication on Singapore and its people. This can be done through schools, at workplaces and in public places with educational posters and documentary films. Extensively promoting these recycling, reducing or replacing the usage of plastics. This can be done by providing greater access and incentives for one to exchange empty bottles for coins − a practice found in Sweden. Pushing for consumers to bring their recyclable bags and not providing the alternative of plastic carrier bags could also be considered. It is the age old culture that we need to reignite. About 19% of carbon emission comes from transportation. Can we do more in getting electric vehicles instead of petroleum cars to ply our roads if our effort to make Singaporeans switch to public transport remains a challenge? Can we better incentivise companies and individuals to encourage such efforts? The food we eat is what we are and what the environmental impact will be. It is important to educate Singaporeans on food that poses negative impact on the environment. \"The biggest intervention people could make towards reducing their carbon footprints is to eat significantly less red meat,\" said Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds. A research, led by scientists at the Oxford Martin School, found that shifting to a mostly vegetarian diet, or even simply cutting down meat consumption to within accepted health guidelines, would make a large dent in greenhouse gases. Adhering to health guidelines on meat consumption could cut global food-related emissions by nearly a third by 2050, while widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet would bring down emissions by 63%. Lastly, the eco-friendly award is a timely reminder —</td>\n",

       "0  Mdm Chair, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy intensity − the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) − improved by 1.8% in 2015. This surpassed the 1.5% gain seen in 2014, and triples the annual rate of 0.6% seen in the previous decade, according to IEA Energy Efficiency Market Report for 2016. But the report added that and I quote: \"However, global progress on energy intensity is still too slow, falling short of putting the world onto a sustainable pathway toward a decarbonised energy system. IEA analysis shows that annual energy intensity improvements need to rise immediately to at least 2.6% in a trajectory consistent with our climate goals.\" I would like to ask the Minister how is our performance in industrial energy efficiency efforts compared with other countries? What is the feedback from industries on the obstacles they are facing and what can the Ministry do to address these concerns? How are we to fulfil our commitment to the Paris Agreement? Are there any new plans to improve on our industrial energy efficiency? Our city state has done well in managing the air quality from vehicle emission. Unlike the days before year 2000, certainly we hardly see smoky vehicles on our roads, except some from across the causeway. Even the public can report to NEA if they see any smoky vehicles on our road. NEA requires periodic checks for buses and diesel vehicles and we strive to reduce domestic emissions to meet the 2020 air quality targets benchmarked against WHO standards. We have been successful and there are lessons to be learnt from what is happening in China, India and France where smoke from vehicle emission had created havoc on the ambient air quality. The toll can be very serious as we can see how the haze impacted the health of the people. WHO has pointed out that air pollution pose one of the biggest environmental health risks, especially for heart diseases. Can the Minister update the House on what is the strategy to achieve these targets and what has been done so far to improve the air quality in Singapore? Diesel vehicles are found to be the major culprit in polluting the air. In December 2016, four of the world's largest and most polluted cities have decided to ban diesel cars and trucks from their streets by 2025. Diesel engines emit particulates into the air at ground level, as well as emit nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides can help form ground-level ozone, which can lead to breathing difficulties for those suffering from respiratory problems. According to WHO, seven million deaths every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. At the last COS debate, we were told that a study on diesel vehicles would be undertaken by SUTD. I understand that it has recently submitted a report on alternative technologies to the Ministry. Can the Minister share with the House the outcome of this study? What next after this? There are some older commercial vehicles retained by their owners which do not meet current day emission standards. What are the Ministry's plans to address these old commercial vehicles? Will the ETS be extended? Apart from this, what are plans to curb emission from petrol cars and motorcycles? Next, I would like to briefly point out that there is much that can be done to improve the waste collection system. Frequently, we can see cleaners manually hauling refuse to the bin centres from the chutes at the HDB blocks. This gives rise to complaints from residents about the odour and the spread of pests when this exercise is not done properly. Are there any plans for the Ministry to improve on this waste disposal by cleaners? I note that the cost of water supply has risen over the years and the Government is raising prices by 30% in two phases from this July. I think what we need to do is to share with Singaporeans what the Government is doing to meet future demand and make our country resilient against any supply disruption especially in the current uncertain weather conditions? This would I feel at least make the people understand and appreciate the big picture behind the price increase. While on climate change, I would like to ask the Minister what are PUB's plans to cope with the unpredictable and intense rainfall that we may encounter in this age of weather turbulence. I know there were drainage works carried out to alleviate flooding, but as the past months have shown, there are many pockets in our midst where more work is required. I hope the Minister can update the House on the work done so far on the Stamford Diversion Canal, Stamford Detention Tank, and the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. Has any of these been completed, and if so how have they helped to prevent flooding in key areas? On PUB, I would like to ask if the Minister can update us on the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme which was launched a decade ago. Where are we now? What more can we expect of ABC Waters for this financial year? Recently, the NEA has designated smoking areas in busy downtown Orchard Road. I do not know if this is after taking a cue from Nee Soon South, where we have successfully put up 42 Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) and eight more in progress; a total of 50 DSPs. I hope the Orchard Road experience is positive. May I ask what plans are there to further expand this to other parts of Singapore, and protect the public from inhaling second-hand cigarette smoke?   \n",

Are there other measures that we can put in place to incentivise the individual firms to be prudent and compel them to use alternative sources of energy? With this tax, are we on track to meeting our commitment to lower carbon emission? Has the Ministry explored other initiatives considering the level of carbon emitted in our day-to-day life may have compounded the problem? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider further reviewing the following. One, creating greater awareness of the importance of addressing climate change and its implication on Singapore and its people. This can be done through schools, at workplaces and in public places with educational posters and documentary films. Extensively promoting these recycling, reducing or replacing the usage of plastics. This can be done by providing greater access and incentives for one to exchange empty bottles for coins − a practice found in Sweden. Pushing for consumers to bring their recyclable bags and not providing the alternative of plastic carrier bags could also be considered. It is the age old culture that we need to reignite. About 19% of carbon emission comes from transportation. Can we do more in getting electric vehicles instead of petroleum cars to ply our roads if our effort to make Singaporeans switch to public transport remains a challenge? Can we better incentivise companies and individuals to encourage such efforts? The food we eat is what we are and what the environmental impact will be. It is important to educate Singaporeans on food that poses negative impact on the environment. \"The biggest intervention people could make towards reducing their carbon footprints is to eat significantly less red meat,\" said Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds. A research, led by scientists at the Oxford Martin School, found that shifting to a mostly vegetarian diet, or even simply cutting down meat consumption to within accepted health guidelines, would make a large dent in greenhouse gases. Adhering to health guidelines on meat consumption could cut global food-related emissions by nearly a third by 2050, while widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet would bring down emissions by 63%.

Our Nation, Singapore is a young country. We are celebrating our 54th National day this August. The task of nation building is an endless one. It is one that needs all Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion to come together, rally together as one united people and one nation. We come together to celebrate every success Singapore achieved, to celebrate our uniquely Singaporean culture, food, arts and sports. It only seems like not so long ago when young Singaporean were thought to be politically and socially apathetic. Yet today, we have an increasingly mature citizenry with a diverse array of views and hopes for their own future, and for the future of Singapore. These can be attributed to a society with growing literacy and affluence, where they are able to take the focus off from bread and butter issues to other matters and issues that affect their lives. The widespread use of social media certainly helps them and rallies them in expressing their views. And, the Government needs to do more to engage and partner Singaporeans in the next exciting phase of nation building. Our youths and our older Singaporeans who have found common ground have bandied together and created groups to promote their causes. They participate in forums and focus group discussions. They are vocal on social media, some are more sophisticated with their analyses and feedback, others less so. But it is evident that many Singaporeans would like to have an active role in nation-building and shaping the future. Some expressed their views through arts, music and culture. However, some are unsure of the available avenues, or lack the capability to do so. MCCY has been taking the lead in ensuring that citizens are actively involved in our nation building, in policy deliberation and design. Online feedback portals, community outreach events, facilitation of networking events for stakeholders and volunteers to come together are some examples of ways in which Singaporeans can engage in nation-building. Nevertheless, majority of the engagement feels top-down, in the sense that citizens provide feedback, and Government works on it. We need to move away from a top down approach to a less paternalistic approach. The Government need to create more space, room and opportunities for Singaporeans to participate. For those who are ready to do more, particularly Singaporeans with leadership qualities, good ethics and are socially well-connected, they should have more opportunities to participate. They could create social projects and lead teams of volunteers. For those who are not ready, perhaps they lack comprehension of policies, or skills to articulate their aspirations and feedback, and we must help them to grow their capability. This can be done through giving them access to the necessary information, and the skills to participate. Many Singaporeans still find certain policies to be too complex to understand and they do not get why certain policies have to be this way. If the Ministry could come up with more creative means to break down these policies for the layman, that would be helpful. It is prudent that all citizens in Singapore have a stake in nation-building, to ensure equality and for everyone’s interests to be cared for. Our population has always been and will always be our best resource, and with a more well-informed population, there will be more and better possibilities. As we face more complex issues, we will be able to tap on the collective wisdom and expertise of our citizenry. There is strength in numbers; as we build Singapore together, we can work towards creating the best Singapore that we can, one that all citizens have a stake in. I would like to ask how will the Ministry continue engaging citizens in nation-building? How can we raise the commitment levels towards building a Singaporean society where everyone can continue to be proud of our country and its achievements? Question proposed.</td>\n",

If the Ministry could come up with more creative means to break down these policies for the layman, that would be helpful. It is prudent that all citizens in Singapore have a stake in nation-building, to ensure equality and for everyone’s interests to be cared for. Our population has always been and will always be our best resource, and with a more well-informed population, there will be more and better possibilities. As we face more complex issues, we will be able to tap on the collective wisdom and expertise of our citizenry. There is strength in numbers; as we build Singapore together, we can work towards creating the best Singapore that we can, one that all citizens have a stake in. I would like to ask how will the Ministry continue engaging citizens in nation-building? How can we raise the commitment levels towards building a Singaporean society where everyone can continue to be proud of our country and its achievements? Question proposed.   \n",

Madrasah institutions have an illustrious tradition. They are important in equipping generations of azatizahs with a firm foundation in both secular and religious subjects. These azatizahs are our community assets and we are very proud of them. It is critical that we ensure madrasah students and teachers in Singapore continue to receive ample support and opportunities to fulfil their potential. What is being done to enhance our madrasahs so that they can continue to produce good quality graduates and continue its illustrious tradition? The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.   \n",

       "      <td>Chairman, I would like to speak briefly about sports today – the role of sports in our lives and in our community. And I would like to start by recalling Minister Edwin Tong's response to one of my Parliamentary Questions recently. In his response, Minister laid out very comprehensively the overall framework – of our sporting system, sporting programmes and sporting infrastructure – and at various levels, from sports in the community, to sporting performance at the highest level. And his response reminded me then that sports is a little bit like clean air in our lives; we tend to forget that it is there, until it is no longer there. But I think through years of effort, we have built up a framework that has allowed sports to become so integral – a part of our lives and our community here in Singapore. It is in this spirit that I raise two questions, around what more we can do to strengthen the role of sports in our lives and our community. First, on inclusive sports. Sports has the power to uplift and empower individuals. It uplifts the spirit, it allows for the display and expression of talent and flair, it can help a person discover him or herself. By extension, sports has the power to uplift and empower whole segments in society – more vulnerable children, youths at risk, persons with disabilities, seniors. It can transform lives. The Delta League by the Home Team is a good example. And SportSG has also launched the SportCares programme. So, can MCCY share its future plans on its SportCares programme, so that we can continue to grow a movement of inclusive sports to transform lives in Singapore? Chairman, second, on high-performance sports. As Singaporeans, we cheer our national athletes on when they compete, we celebrate with them when they win and partake in their disappointment when they do not. But I think we will reach the next level in our high-performance sporting culture here in Singapore when we can go beyond spectatorship, transcend spectatorship, to be an active part of the system and an active part of the movement. And in this respect, MCCY has created a One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF), where individuals and corporates can make donations with dollar-for-dollar matching by the Government. Can MCCY share its future plans on this Fund, so that we can continue to encourage a spirit of giving towards high performance sports in Singapore?</td>\n",

       "2  Chairman, I would like to speak briefly about sports today – the role of sports in our lives and in our community. And I would like to start by recalling Minister Edwin Tong's response to one of my Parliamentary Questions recently. In his response, Minister laid out very comprehensively the overall framework – of our sporting system, sporting programmes and sporting infrastructure – and at various levels, from sports in the community, to sporting performance at the highest level. And his response reminded me then that sports is a little bit like clean air in our lives; we tend to forget that it is there, until it is no longer there. But I think through years of effort, we have built up a framework that has allowed sports to become so integral – a part of our lives and our community here in Singapore. It is in this spirit that I raise two questions, around what more we can do to strengthen the role of sports in our lives and our community. First, on inclusive sports. Sports has the power to uplift and empower individuals. It uplifts the spirit, it allows for the display and expression of talent and flair, it can help a person discover him or herself. By extension, sports has the power to uplift and empower whole segments in society – more vulnerable children, youths at risk, persons with disabilities, seniors. It can transform lives. The Delta League by the Home Team is a good example. And SportSG has also launched the SportCares programme. So, can MCCY share its future plans on its SportCares programme, so that we can continue to grow a movement of inclusive sports to transform lives in Singapore? Chairman, second, on high-performance sports. As Singaporeans, we cheer our national athletes on when they compete, we celebrate with them when they win and partake in their disappointment when they do not. But I think we will reach the next level in our high-performance sporting culture here in Singapore when we can go beyond spectatorship, transcend spectatorship, to be an active part of the system and an active part of the movement. And in this respect, MCCY has created a One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF), where individuals and corporates can make donations with dollar-for-dollar matching by the Government. Can MCCY share its future plans on this Fund, so that we can continue to encourage a spirit of giving towards high performance sports in Singapore?"

She said that as a successor of Chinese dance performance in Singapore, her dances were Chinese dance infused with new elements. She hopes that policymakers will not drag their feet and lock themselves in the old mindset where \"modern dance movements should not be seen in Chinese dances\" and, hence, restricting the new forms of Chinese dances. Otherwise, sooner or later, Chinese dances will have no young audiences. May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what is the definition of traditional arts? Would the new forms of Chinese dance or other traditional arts infused with new elements be eligible for grants under the Traditional Arts Plan?</td>\n",

       "2  A report in Zaobao's arts section yesterday quoted Cai Shiji, Creative Director of Dance Ensemble Singapore. She said that as a successor of Chinese dance performance in Singapore, her dances were Chinese dance infused with new elements. She hopes that policymakers will not drag their feet and lock themselves in the old mindset where \"modern dance movements should not be seen in Chinese dances\" and, hence, restricting the new forms of Chinese dances. Otherwise, sooner or later, Chinese dances will have no young audiences. May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what is the definition of traditional arts? Would the new forms of Chinese dance or other traditional arts infused with new elements be eligible for grants under the Traditional Arts Plan?"

       "      <td>Sir, our Malay/Muslim community has been an integral part of our country from Singapore's beginning. Our journey has been Singapore's journey. We strived hard to forge a better life and household incomes grew. The community – from mothers and fathers to Cikgu in every classroom – put great emphasis on education as never before, and significant progress was made. Our community also emphasised mutual help and cooperation, especially in times of need. The spirit of gotong-royong was the driving force behind our community's setting up of Singapore's first Self-Help Group in 1982 to uplift education outcomes. Today, MENDAKI's education programmes support over 20,000 students every year. Our community also work hand-in-hand with our Government to build the legal and institutional foundations of our socio-religious life through the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). Sir, this generation faces challenges no less trying than in the past. We are in the midst of another economic transformation, brought about by a digital revolution no less fundamental than the industrial revolution. We must prepare our industries and workers for the future economy, and we must make sure no one is left behind. We also face an ongoing threat to our faith. The spread of extremist ideologies abetted by social media and the acts of terror by ISIS have set Muslims against non-Muslims in many societies. Misguided religious preachers have spread insidious ideologies preaching segregation and a rejection of modern life and the secular state. This is surely the road to alienation, marginalisation and ruin. In Singapore, we must stand united against such ideologues and ideologies, and against Islamophobia. Sir, we have three key strategies going forward. First, we will continue our efforts to support our families and children, with an emphasis on early childhood education and helping the vulnerable. Second, we will enhance the socio-religious foundations of the community, by strengthening religious education and our key community institutions. Thirdly, we will build a future-ready community that embraces technology. We want to ensure that every child has the best start in life. Good early childhood education is critical for a child's long-term development. We urge our parents to send their children to quality preschool education. To Mr Saktiandi Supaat's question, the importance of early childhood education is why MENDAKI has, in recent years, focused more on supporting the development of children between zero and six years old. Last year, MENDAKI held its inaugural Education Symposium, supported by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and the Learn SG seed fund. Over 250 participants benefitted from discussions ranging from learning through play to preparing for Primary school. Following the symposium, Mdm Irma Iryanti Juri, an adjunct lecturer at SEED institute, which trains early childhood professionals, and Mdm Shaireen Selamat a doctoral researcher from the University of Warwick volunteered to lead the setting up a network of professionals and educators from the pre-school sector to share best practices and learn from each other. Today, this network has become the MENDAKI Alliance of Pre-school Professionals, or MAPP, comprising about 30 professionals who actively support MENDAKI's School-Ready programmes. Mdm Irma and Mdm Shaireen are examples of passionate individuals taking the initiative to make a difference. Sir, given this encouraging response, MENDAKI will be organising a second run of the Education Symposium and a Playfest for Pre-schoolers next month. Playfest aims to generate awareness about the benefits of play, and provide parents with ideas on setting up an age-appropriate stimulating learning environment at home. We want to help more low-income families enrol their children into full-day childcare, as this provides a conducive environment for the child's development. The \"Back-to-Work Women\" programme is a key strategy in this effort, as it aims to help mothers to be gainfully employed. Besides enhancing the family's income, they will be able to tap on more childcare subsidies, and quality preschool education will indeed become more affordable. MENDAKI will also work with ECDA and MSF on ways to study how we can assist low-income families enrol their children in quality childcare and pre-school education. Both Mr Saktiandi and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about how we can best support our students' education. Twenty years ago, less than half of Malays entered post-secondary educational institutions. Today, almost all Malay students do so. We are committed to help as many as we can, to ensure that our young have a brighter future, and can access more opportunities than before. For Primary and Secondary school students, the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme (MTS), offers highly subsidised tuition sessions for students from lower income families. For the past five years, MTS has been helping over 10,000 students every year, across 89 centres island-wide. To Assoc Prof Fatimah's question about students who face challenges in receiving help from Self-Help Groups, MENDAKI provides a wide range of assistance schemes, as long as they meet the criteria. Any Muslim student can apply to MENDAKI for interest-free study loans and a wide range of bursaries and scholarships, while the best students, who excel in both academic and non-academic areas, would receive the Anugerah MENDAKI award. Sir, MENDAKI also administers the Education Trust Fund that supports the lower income. Since 2003, $22.9 million from the Fund has been disbursed to support 91,000 students, from pre-school all the way to ITE. As Mr Saktiandi mentioned, a key Government policy that supports the education of low-income Malay students is the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy scheme (TTFS). Muhammad Azhari Bin Mohammad Zain is one beneficiary who, despite his challenging financial circumstances, graduated with First Class Honours in Biological Science from Nanyang Technological University, and he is now a scientist at the AVA. We are committed to helping all who deserve and seek assistance. In this regard, I am pleased to announce that we will revise the TTFS income eligibility criteria. Sir, we recognise that the Per Capita Income (PCI) of families have risen over the last few years. As such, we are revising the income bands upwards. Students from households with PCI $1,400 and below will receive 100% subsidy; those with PCI between $1,400 and $1,700 will receive $75% subsidy; and those with PCI between $1,700 and $2,000 will receive 50% subsidy. Sir, the revisions will take effect for Academic Year 2018/2019. MENDAKI will provide more details. Mr Muhammad Faisal Abdul Manap spoke about the Malay identity. For such matters, the Government takes a practical approach bearing in mind the interest of the community and the wider society. No matter how \"Malayness\" is defined, what matters is how we grow and sustain a strong community. And in this regard, the quality of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs), is indeed critical. I am glad that many of our MMOs, and even our mosques, are serving not only our community, but also reaching out to non-Malay/Muslims. MMOs like Jamiyah, 4PM and PPIS offer assistance to those in need, regardless of race or religion. Such efforts must continue, and as a community, we must support the good work of our MMOs. Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar and Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked about the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund (MMCDF), which was established to support all MMOs. The MMCDF has evolved over the years. In its last review in 2014, the Government reallocated a portion of the matching grant for MENDAKI and AMP towards increasing its matching grant for the MMCDF, to provide greater support to MMOs that have less resources. The MMCDF also shifted its focus towards helping organisations build their capabilities. Between 2015 and 2017, $10 million was disbursed, benefitting around 55 partners per year. Some of the initiatives that receive MMCDF funding include the Debt Advisory Centre by AMP, the Rising Star Project by PERTAPIS and the Family Therapy Institute by PPIS. Sir, these are key projects that serve the community in important areas, and I strongly urge and encourage our community organisations to continue tapping on the MMCDF. While we support our established MMOs, I share Dr Intan's view that we must also provide the opportunities and support for our talented youths to step up and contribute to the greater good of both community and society. MENDAKI has several platforms to support this. The CLF LABS allows youth-led organisations and groups to test-bed innovative ideas with MENDAKI's seed funding. The inaugural Socialthon, held last July, brought together close to 100 youths to develop solutions in areas such as start-up culture, health and technology. These platforms will help our youth hone their ideas and leadership skills, with the community and Singapore at heart. Strong families are critical to the well-being of children. While the proportion of minor marriages has declined from 10% of Muslim marriages in 2007 to 3.6% in 2017, this group still needs support. We amended AMLA last year to make it compulsory for minor couples to complete marriage preparation programmes and to obtain consent from parents or guardians, prior to making an application for marriage. To reply to Ms Rahayu Mahzam, MSF is working with ROMM and INSPIRASI Hubs. The Hubs, are centres dedicated to preparing minor and young couples for marriage and to raise awareness of these new requirements and the importance of marriage preparation and parental support. MSF is also working with the Hubs to enhance the marriage preparation curriculum. The new requirements will apply to minor marriage applications from 1st October this year. The programme will benefit about 200 minor couples every year. Sir, to better support step-families, MSF will work closely with PPIS Vista Sakinah, the centre for remarriages and stepfamilies. Vista Sakinah will collaborate with agencies serving low-income step-families and waive the remarriage preparation programme fees for their participation. They will provide step-family awareness talks at key touch points, such as mosques and other community agencies, and leverage on social media and radio. Additionally, Vista Sakinah will enhance its programme effectiveness by strengthening its evidence-based content, building trainer capabilities, and enhancing its programme evaluation. Our community is committed to developing strong institutions that support the socio-religious life of our community. So, I wish to assure Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Amrin Amin that we are committed to continually enhance our full-time madrasahs. Our madrasahs play a dual role in nurturing future asatizahs for the community, and in preparing those who opt for careers in the non-religious sectors. I will share plans to strengthen two of our madrasahs. Madrasah Wak Tanjong, founded by the late Ustaz Mohd Noor bin Taib, is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. Its students have a history of excelling in religious studies, and taking up religious leadership roles in the community. One example is Ustazah Hilwani binte Mohammad Abdul Halim. She is the daughter of the late Ustaz Mohammad Abdul Halim, who was the Principal of Madrasah Wak Tanjong for five years. She does her late father proud by teaching Islamic Jurisprudence and Arabic at Madrasah Wak Tanjong. Hilwani holds a Bachelor's Degree in Islamic Jurisprudence from the University of Jordan, but she is determined to better herself as a teacher. She is now enrolled in a specialist diploma programme in Applied Learning and Teaching at Republic Polytechnic under MUIS' sponsorship and will graduate in August this year. We wish Hilwani all the best and look forward to her wider contributions to the community. Sir, I am pleased to share that MUIS will be providing Madrasah Wak Tanjong with a Comprehensive Assistance Package that includes an extension of its lease at its current premises, and the provision of additional funding to strengthen its curriculum and professional development. This strong support signals MUIS' ongoing commitment to further professionalise and strengthen the madrasah sector as a whole. I am also happy to present the design of the new Madrasah Al Arabiah Al Islamiah campus. It has a sustainable and green design that is complemented with Islamic and nusantara architecture. MUIS will hold a project launch later this month, and has committed $10 million for this project. I urge the community to support the madrasah's fund-raising efforts, to ensure that the campus can be operational by 2020. Sir, as we strengthen the infrastructure of our madrasahs, we pay close attention to curriculum development and teacher training. First, the introduction of the government-supported financial incentives for madrasah teachers in secular subjects has benefitted more than 170 teachers. Similarly, over 500 students received the Madrasah Student Awards just last month in recognition of their educational excellence. Second, Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah is on track to offer a small cohort of 27 students an International Baccalaureate curriculum in 2019. School leaders, IB coordinators and teachers have been hard at work in equipping themselves with the necessary skills and qualifications. Third, MUIS has worked with the madrasahs to strengthen the holistic development of their students, so that they are exposed to areas such as youth volunteerism, service learning projects and outdoor education. We want our students to go beyond the classroom, to interact with and contribute to the larger Singapore society. Mr Chairman, our madrasah graduates are our future asatizahs. In this regard, we have been looking into plans to develop an Islamic college in Singapore. Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked for an update. Sir, in recent months, officials from MUIS and myself visited institutions of higher learning in the Middle East such as in Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, as well as universities in multi-religious, plural societies, such as in the US and Canada, to study the different models of tertiary Islamic education. So, for example, both Al-Azhar University and University of Jordan traditionally produce religious teachers, while the latter also trains its students with broad-based skills for employability in the non-religious sector for the wider economy. The Turkish universities take an academic approach in teaching classical Islamic sciences and the humanities, while its Diyanet, or the Turkish central religious authority, separately provides religious vocational training. On the other hand, Zaytuna College and Notre Dame University in the US, and McGill University in Canada, take a rigorous, academic approach to produce scholars. The different learning approaches provide useful learning points and each is suited to its own society and context. An Islamic college in Singapore would adapt appropriate features from overseas institutions, so that we will, in time, produce Islamic teachers and scholars who balance a deep learning of Islamic sciences with broad-based skills and knowledge, and more importantly are rooted in the belief and practice of Islam in Singapore's multi-religious and multi-racial context. We also took the opportunity to meet our Singaporean students studying in these institutions. The students highlighted how social issues have become more complex and perspectives are more diverse. They emphasised how, for Singapore, religious teachers must be able to guide Muslims in living out the religion as members of our modern, plural society. They shared their concerns about employability, safety, and the cost of education. I appreciate their frank views, which we will consider carefully in developing a high quality tertiary education. Sir, I believe we can succeed in developing our own Islamic college. It would not be easy. But with hard work and taking the time to carefully study this undertaking, I am confident that we can develop an institution that will nurture future asatizah whom our community looks up to, and supports wholeheartedly. In the coming months, MUIS will be engaging the community for their views, so that our first Islamic college in Singapore will be a centre of excellence for the learning of Islam that we can all be proud of. While we plan for the future of religious education, we wish to encourage talented young asatizahs to engage our youths. I agree with Mr Zainal Sapari that we must inoculate our young from extremist and segregationist views. We must not allow such ideologies to take root in Singapore. We must start early and focus on upstream work. The Asatizah Youth Network, or AYN, was formed last year with 11 asatizah to offer support and guidance to our youths on social media as well as be the first touch point for those in doubt. Ustaz Tarmizi Wahid belongs to this pioneer batch. He is the CEO and founder of Safinah Institute, a private Islamic learning centre with a strong digital media presence, especially on Instagram. Safinah also operates a digital device-friendly platform called Soul Academy, where participants can virtually interact and discuss issues with trainers and peers. The AYN has been active in increasing outreach both online and offline. In October 2017, they collaborated with the Religious Rehabilitation Group, or RRG, and PERGAS to organise a Seminar on Strengthening the Religious Resilience of the Singapore Muslim Community for about 300 asatizah and community leaders. In December, they produced a video series #TheProphetIKnow, featuring the AYN asatizah promoting the values that the Prophet stood for and how Muslims contribute to the larger society. This video production was done following AYN's participation in a workshop on effective counter-narrative and digital engagements conducted by Google Singapore. Over the next five years, MUIS aims to grow the AYN membership, conduct drop-in sessions for youths at Al-Falah Mosque in Orchard Road, and continue training asatizah in digital media engagements and counselling techniques to counter youth radicalism. Sir, MUIS is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. MUIS has grown its scope of work in serving the socio-religious needs of the community. This includes increasing prayer spaces in mosques, distributing zakat and facilitating hajj and korban. In doing so, MUIS has endeavoured to maintain strong partnerships with key community stakeholders. September 11, the spectre of extremism and the emergence of charismatic Internet-age radical ideologues have made MUIS’ mission all the more difficult. But MUIS has stayed the course in nurturing a Singapore Muslim Identity – one that honours the Islamic faith, the aspirations of our community, and the relationships and identities that bind us to Singapore, our home. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim asked about plans for this significant milestone. The theme \"Semarak Langkah, Berjiwa Rahmah\" or \"Striving with Confidence, Serving with Compassion\" is apt in portraying the spirit of MUIS' service to the community. MUIS will be holding a special MUIS 50 Dinner and Awards Ceremony, and present awards that honour individuals who have been instrumental to MUIS and Singapore, and also to inspire youths. MUIS will also hold an International Religious Conference at the end of the year to rally the community on the important role of religious scholars and institutions in shaping a progressive religious life. MUIS is currently engaging the community through the ongoing MUIS50 conversations for ideas to strengthen MUIS for the future. More details will be shared at MUIS' Work Plan Seminar next month. Mr Chairman, allow me to elaborate on our third strategy of forging a future ready community. Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked about what more we can do to support our students and workers better. MENDAKI partnered the three ITE colleges for its Future First Programme (FFP). Benefitting about 240 ITE students currently, the FFP complements ITE’s education and career guidance and life skills curriculum. MENDAKI will be expanding the programme to even more ITE students, partnering Polytechnics and the wider youth community. This would include the launch of a Future-Ready Starter Kit in August 2018 on workplace expectations, and strategies to remain relevant in the future economy. With improving educational attainment by Malay students, we have seen a higher proportion of PMETs in the Malay workforce. The proportion of PMETs has increased from one in four in 2007 to one in three in 2017, with a majority in education, health, social services and public administration. Of these, about two thirds are associate professionals and technicians. We also see that Malays have a higher than proportional share of placements under the Adapt and Grow initiative, which includes the career centres run by Workforce Singapore and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute. We want to help our workers and encourage skills upgrading. I have asked Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin to lead a PMET Outreach Committee to create a support network for Malay/Muslim PMETs' retraining and employability needs. The Committee has leveraged on key platforms such as SENSE PMET Jobfair@Grassroots Club and \"Secangkir Kopi bersama MENDAKI\" dialogue and networking session. The Committee produced and distributed more than 3,000 copies of the \"Handy Guidebook for PMETs\" to raise awareness on support schemes. The Committee intends to do more engagements, with 4 \"JUMP! Career Fairs” to offer assistance and raise awareness about growth sectors in Singapore. Sir, as Mr Zaqy Mohamad has highlighted, digitalisation is a key driver of growth in the future economy, and our community must adapt quickly to remain relevant and competitive in this age of disruptive technology. MUIS and MENDAKI have already started using digital tools to improve service delivery and accessibility. For example, MUIS has placed the Asatizah Recognition Scheme, or ARS, procedures online, on the LicenceOne portal to make it easier for registration and to undertake data analytics on the asatizah sector. MENDAKI's Tuition Scheme Online Programme Registration System and Loan Management System have enhanced user convenience and organisation productivity. The data collected through tuition registration enables the team to analyse the profiles of students and their families, and helps us to tailor programmes and outreach according to students' performance. I am pleased to share that MENDAKI has set up a Digital Transformation Department that will help facilitate the digital transformation of our MMOs, so that the community can ultimately benefit. One MMO that has started its digitalisation journey is PPIS. PPIS currently serves about 500 students across seven centres and they want to attract more families with pre-school going children. PPIS is partnering MENDAKI on a data-analytics project to better understand the profiles and needs of client families, so that PPIS can offer higher quality and relevant services. Going digital is vital for our SMEs too. I had the opportunity to engage members of the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or SMCCI. It is heartening to see Malay/Muslim SMEs such as Frozi, an F&amp;B establishment that serves frozen yogurt, and Spear Security Force, a security company, making good progress with their first use of digital solutions to increase revenue and improve productivity. We want to encourage more, if not all, Malay/Muslim SMEs to take that critical first step. We have been working with SME Centre@SMCCI, supported by IMDA's SME Digital Tech Hub, to organise workshops for members. With SMCCI taking the lead to help their members tap on SMEs Go Digital programme, I believe more MM SMEs will come on board. We can also use digital technology to harness the richness of our heritage and culture. Kampong Glam has historically been an open community and welcomes people of different ages and cultures. We want to see if we can enhance the customer and retail experience and transform the overall visitor experience at Kampong Glam. As I mentioned in my MCI COS speech, IMDA is working together with SMCCI, One Kampong Gelam Association, and other partners to create Singapore's first digitally enabled retail neighbourhood. For a start, we will guide Kampong Glam merchants on how they can digitalise themselves to improve their business operations. Today, there are already existing merchants doing so. Take for example, Wardah Bookstore. Wardah sells a wide range of books from Islamic history to philosophy. It actively uses social media, and it has also digitalises its processes so that data accounting is integrated between its physical and online store. The presence of an online store not only directs traffic to the physical store, but boosts its reach to overseas customers in Malaysia and Brunei. Digitalisation will be a key anchor for our community's future growth. This is why I urge our workforce to be future-ready, and our community organisations and SMEs to transform, so that we and our future generations can continue to achieve our hopes and aspirations. Sir, allow me to continue in Malay.</td>\n",

dispense religious knowledge that is based on lived reality and are able to address emerging issues, such as cryptocurrency and plant-based food. It is important that the asatizah are equipped with the necessary skills to engage the community effectively. How can our asatizah further engage and contribute to the community’s needs, beyond that of a religious teacher? Will MUIS provide assistance and support so that the asatizah are better equipped to contribute in the fields mentioned earlier?\n",
       "2  Sir, our Malay/Muslim community has been an integral part of our country from Singapore's beginning. Our journey has been Singapore's journey. We strived hard to forge a better life and household incomes grew. The community – from mothers and fathers to Cikgu in every classroom – put great emphasis on education as never before, and significant progress was made. Our community also emphasised mutual help and cooperation, especially in times of need. The spirit of gotong-royong was the driving force behind our community's setting up of Singapore's first Self-Help Group in 1982 to uplift education outcomes. Today, MENDAKI's education programmes support over 20,000 students every year. Our community also work hand-in-hand with our Government to build the legal and institutional foundations of our socio-religious life through the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). Sir, this generation faces challenges no less trying than in the past. We are in the midst of another economic transformation, brought about by a digital revolution no less fundamental than the industrial revolution. We must prepare our industries and workers for the future economy, and we must make sure no one is left behind. We also face an ongoing threat to our faith. The spread of extremist ideologies abetted by social media and the acts of terror by ISIS have set Muslims against non-Muslims in many societies. Misguided religious preachers have spread insidious ideologies preaching segregation and a rejection of modern life and the secular state. This is surely the road to alienation, marginalisation and ruin. In Singapore, we must stand united against such ideologues and ideologies, and against Islamophobia. Sir, we have three key strategies going forward. First, we will continue our efforts to support our families and children, with an emphasis on early childhood education and helping the vulnerable. Second, we will enhance the socio-religious foundations of the community, by strengthening religious education and our key community institutions. Thirdly, we will build a future-ready community that embraces technology. We want to ensure that every child has the best start in life. Good early childhood education is critical for a child's long-term development. We urge our parents to send their children to quality preschool education. To Mr Saktiandi Supaat's question, the importance of early childhood education is why MENDAKI has, in recent years, focused more on supporting the development of children between zero and six years old. Last year, MENDAKI held its inaugural Education Symposium, supported by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and the Learn SG seed fund. Over 250 participants benefitted from discussions ranging from learning through play to preparing for Primary school. Following the symposium, Mdm Irma Iryanti Juri, an adjunct lecturer at SEED institute, which trains early childhood professionals, and Mdm Shaireen Selamat a doctoral researcher from the University of Warwick volunteered to lead the setting up a network of professionals and educators from the pre-school sector to share best practices and learn from each other. Today, this network has become the MENDAKI Alliance of Pre-school Professionals, or MAPP, comprising about 30 professionals who actively support MENDAKI's School-Ready programmes. Mdm Irma and Mdm Shaireen are examples of passionate individuals taking the initiative to make a difference. Sir, given this encouraging response, MENDAKI will be organising a second run of the Education Symposium and a Playfest for Pre-schoolers next month. Playfest aims to generate awareness about the benefits of play, and provide parents with ideas on setting up an age-appropriate stimulating learning environment at home. We want to help more low-income families enrol their children into full-day childcare, as this provides a conducive environment for the child's development. The \"Back-to-Work Women\" programme is a key strategy in this effort, as it aims to help mothers to be gainfully employed. Besides enhancing the family's income, they will be able to tap on more childcare subsidies, and quality preschool education will indeed become more affordable. MENDAKI will also work with ECDA and MSF on ways to study how we can assist low-income families enrol their children in quality childcare and pre-school education. Both Mr Saktiandi and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about how we can best support our students' education. Twenty years ago, less than half of Malays entered post-secondary educational institutions. Today, almost all Malay students do so. We are committed to help as many as we can, to ensure that our young have a brighter future, and can access more opportunities than before. For Primary and Secondary school students, the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme (MTS), offers highly subsidised tuition sessions for students from lower income families. For the past five years, MTS has been helping over 10,000 students every year, across 89 centres island-wide. To Assoc Prof Fatimah's question about students who face challenges in receiving help from Self-Help Groups, MENDAKI provides a wide range of assistance schemes, as long as they meet the criteria. Any Muslim student can apply to MENDAKI for interest-free study loans and a wide range of bursaries and scholarships, while the best students, who excel in both academic and non-academic areas, would receive the Anugerah MENDAKI award. Sir, MENDAKI also administers the Education Trust Fund that supports the lower income. Since 2003, $22.9 million from the Fund has been disbursed to support 91,000 students, from pre-school all the way to ITE. As Mr Saktiandi mentioned, a key Government policy that supports the education of low-income Malay students is the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy scheme (TTFS). Muhammad Azhari Bin Mohammad Zain is one beneficiary who, despite his challenging financial circumstances, graduated with First Class Honours in Biological Science from Nanyang Technological University, and he is now a scientist at the AVA. We are committed to helping all who deserve and seek assistance. In this regard, I am pleased to announce that we will revise the TTFS income eligibility criteria. Sir, we recognise that the Per Capita Income (PCI) of families have risen over the last few years. As such, we are revising the income bands upwards. Students from households with PCI $1,400 and below will receive 100% subsidy; those with PCI between $1,400 and $1,700 will receive $75% subsidy; and those with PCI between $1,700 and $2,000 will receive 50% subsidy. Sir, the revisions will take effect for Academic Year 2018/2019. MENDAKI will provide more details. Mr Muhammad Faisal Abdul Manap spoke about the Malay identity. For such matters, the Government takes a practical approach bearing in mind the interest of the community and the wider society. No matter how \"Malayness\" is defined, what matters is how we grow and sustain a strong community. And in this regard, the quality of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs), is indeed critical. I am glad that many of our MMOs, and even our mosques, are serving not only our community, but also reaching out to non-Malay/Muslims. MMOs like Jamiyah, 4PM and PPIS offer assistance to those in need, regardless of race or religion. Such efforts must continue, and as a community, we must support the good work of our MMOs. Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar and Mr Azmoon Ahmad asked about the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund (MMCDF), which was established to support all MMOs. The MMCDF has evolved over the years. In its last review in 2014, the Government reallocated a portion of the matching grant for MENDAKI and AMP towards increasing its matching grant for the MMCDF, to provide greater support to MMOs that have less resources. The MMCDF also shifted its focus towards helping organisations build their capabilities. Between 2015 and 2017, $10 million was disbursed, benefitting around 55 partners per year. Some of the initiatives that receive MMCDF funding include the Debt Advisory Centre by AMP, the Rising Star Project by PERTAPIS and the Family Therapy Institute by PPIS. Sir, these are key projects that serve the community in important areas, and I strongly urge and encourage our community organisations to continue tapping on the MMCDF. While we support our established MMOs, I share Dr Intan's view that we must also provide the opportunities and support for our talented youths to step up and contribute to the greater good of both community and society. MENDAKI has several platforms to support this. The CLF LABS allows youth-led organisations and groups to test-bed innovative ideas with MENDAKI's seed funding. The inaugural Socialthon, held last July, brought together close to 100 youths to develop solutions in areas such as start-up culture, health and technology. These platforms will help our youth hone their ideas and leadership skills, with the community and Singapore at heart. Strong families are critical to the well-being of children. While the proportion of minor marriages has declined from 10% of Muslim marriages in 2007 to 3.6% in 2017, this group still needs support. We amended AMLA last year to make it compulsory for minor couples to complete marriage preparation programmes and to obtain consent from parents or guardians, prior to making an application for marriage. To reply to Ms Rahayu Mahzam, MSF is working with ROMM and INSPIRASI Hubs. The Hubs, are centres dedicated to preparing minor and young couples for marriage and to raise awareness of these new requirements and the importance of marriage preparation and parental support. MSF is also working with the Hubs to enhance the marriage preparation curriculum. The new requirements will apply to minor marriage applications from 1st October this year. The programme will benefit about 200 minor couples every year. Sir, to better support step-families, MSF will work closely with PPIS Vista Sakinah, the centre for remarriages and stepfamilies. Vista Sakinah will collaborate with agencies serving low-income step-families and waive the remarriage preparation programme fees for their participation. They will provide step-family awareness talks at key touch points, such as mosques and other community agencies, and leverage on social media and radio. Additionally, Vista Sakinah will enhance its programme effectiveness by strengthening its evidence-based content, building trainer capabilities, and enhancing its programme evaluation. Our community is committed to developing strong institutions that support the socio-religious life of our community. So, I wish to assure Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Amrin Amin that we are committed to continually enhance our full-time madrasahs. Our madrasahs play a dual role in nurturing future asatizahs for the community, and in preparing those who opt for careers in the non-religious sectors. I will share plans to strengthen two of our madrasahs. Madrasah Wak Tanjong, founded by the late Ustaz Mohd Noor bin Taib, is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. Its students have a history of excelling in religious studies, and taking up religious leadership roles in the community. One example is Ustazah Hilwani binte Mohammad Abdul Halim. She is the daughter of the late Ustaz Mohammad Abdul Halim, who was the Principal of Madrasah Wak Tanjong for five years. She does her late father proud by teaching Islamic Jurisprudence and Arabic at Madrasah Wak Tanjong. Hilwani holds a Bachelor's Degree in Islamic Jurisprudence from the University of Jordan, but she is determined to better herself as a teacher. She is now enrolled in a specialist diploma programme in Applied Learning and Teaching at Republic Polytechnic under MUIS' sponsorship and will graduate in August this year. We wish Hilwani all the best and look forward to her wider contributions to the community. Sir, I am pleased to share that MUIS will be providing Madrasah Wak Tanjong with a Comprehensive Assistance Package that includes an extension of its lease at its current premises, and the provision of additional funding to strengthen its curriculum and professional development. This strong support signals MUIS' ongoing commitment to further professionalise and strengthen the madrasah sector as a whole. I am also happy to present the design of the new Madrasah Al Arabiah Al Islamiah campus. It has a sustainable and green design that is complemented with Islamic and nusantara architecture. MUIS will hold a project launch later this month, and has committed $10 million for this project. I urge the community to support the madrasah's fund-raising efforts, to ensure that the campus can be operational by 2020. Sir, as we strengthen the infrastructure of our madrasahs, we pay close attention to curriculum development and teacher training. First, the introduction of the government-supported financial incentives for madrasah teachers in secular subjects has benefitted more than 170 teachers. Similarly, over 500 students received the Madrasah Student Awards just last month in recognition of their educational excellence. Second, Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah is on track to offer a small cohort of 27 students an International Baccalaureate curriculum in 2019. School leaders, IB coordinators and teachers have been hard at work in equipping themselves with the necessary skills and qualifications. Third, MUIS has worked with the madrasahs to strengthen the holistic development of their students, so that they are exposed to areas such as youth volunteerism, service learning projects and outdoor education. We want our students to go beyond the classroom, to interact with and contribute to the larger Singapore society. Mr Chairman, our madrasah graduates are our future asatizahs. In this regard, we have been looking into plans to develop an Islamic college in Singapore. Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked for an update. Sir, in recent months, officials from MUIS and myself visited institutions of higher learning in the Middle East such as in Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, as well as universities in multi-religious, plural societies, such as in the US and Canada, to study the different models of tertiary Islamic education. So, for example, both Al-Azhar University and University of Jordan traditionally produce religious teachers, while the latter also trains its students with broad-based skills for employability in the non-religious sector for the wider economy. The Turkish universities take an academic approach in teaching classical Islamic sciences and the humanities, while its Diyanet, or the Turkish central religious authority, separately provides religious vocational training. On the other hand, Zaytuna College and Notre Dame University in the US, and McGill University in Canada, take a rigorous, academic approach to produce scholars. The different learning approaches provide useful learning points and each is suited to its own society and context. An Islamic college in Singapore would adapt appropriate features from overseas institutions, so that we will, in time, produce Islamic teachers and scholars who balance a deep learning of Islamic sciences with broad-based skills and knowledge, and more importantly are rooted in the belief and practice of Islam in Singapore's multi-religious and multi-racial context. We also took the opportunity to meet our Singaporean students studying in these institutions. The students highlighted how social issues have become more complex and perspectives are more diverse. They emphasised how, for Singapore, religious teachers must be able to guide Muslims in living out the religion as members of our modern, plural society. They shared their concerns about employability, safety, and the cost of education. I appreciate their frank views, which we will consider carefully in developing a high quality tertiary education. Sir, I believe we can succeed in developing our own Islamic college. It would not be easy. But with hard work and taking the time to carefully study this undertaking, I am confident that we can develop an institution that will nurture future asatizah whom our community looks up to, and supports wholeheartedly. In the coming months, MUIS will be engaging the community for their views, so that our first Islamic college in Singapore will be a centre of excellence for the learning of Islam that we can all be proud of. While we plan for the future of religious education, we wish to encourage talented young asatizahs to engage our youths. I agree with Mr Zainal Sapari that we must inoculate our young from extremist and segregationist views. We must not allow such ideologies to take root in Singapore. We must start early and focus on upstream work. The Asatizah Youth Network, or AYN, was formed last year with 11 asatizah to offer support and guidance to our youths on social media as well as be the first touch point for those in doubt. Ustaz Tarmizi Wahid belongs to this pioneer batch. He is the CEO and founder of Safinah Institute, a private Islamic learning centre with a strong digital media presence, especially on Instagram. Safinah also operates a digital device-friendly platform called Soul Academy, where participants can virtually interact and discuss issues with trainers and peers. The AYN has been active in increasing outreach both online and offline. In October 2017, they collaborated with the Religious Rehabilitation Group, or RRG, and PERGAS to organise a Seminar on Strengthening the Religious Resilience of the Singapore Muslim Community for about 300 asatizah and community leaders. In December, they produced a video series #TheProphetIKnow, featuring the AYN asatizah promoting the values that the Prophet stood for and how Muslims contribute to the larger society. This video production was done following AYN's participation in a workshop on effective counter-narrative and digital engagements conducted by Google Singapore. Over the next five years, MUIS aims to grow the AYN membership, conduct drop-in sessions for youths at Al-Falah Mosque in Orchard Road, and continue training asatizah in digital media engagements and counselling techniques to counter youth radicalism. Sir, MUIS is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. MUIS has grown its scope of work in serving the socio-religious needs of the community. This includes increasing prayer spaces in mosques, distributing zakat and facilitating hajj and korban. In doing so, MUIS has endeavoured to maintain strong partnerships with key community stakeholders. September 11, the spectre of extremism and the emergence of charismatic Internet-age radical ideologues have made MUIS’ mission all the more difficult. But MUIS has stayed the course in nurturing a Singapore Muslim Identity – one that honours the Islamic faith, the aspirations of our community, and the relationships and identities that bind us to Singapore, our home. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim asked about plans for this significant milestone. The theme \"Semarak Langkah, Berjiwa Rahmah\" or \"Striving with Confidence, Serving with Compassion\" is apt in portraying the spirit of MUIS' service to the community. MUIS will be holding a special MUIS 50 Dinner and Awards Ceremony, and present awards that honour individuals who have been instrumental to MUIS and Singapore, and also to inspire youths. MUIS will also hold an International Religious Conference at the end of the year to rally the community on the important role of religious scholars and institutions in shaping a progressive religious life. MUIS is currently engaging the community through the ongoing MUIS50 conversations for ideas to strengthen MUIS for the future. More details will be shared at MUIS' Work Plan Seminar next month. Mr Chairman, allow me to elaborate on our third strategy of forging a future ready community. Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked about what more we can do to support our students and workers better. MENDAKI partnered the three ITE colleges for its Future First Programme (FFP). Benefitting about 240 ITE students currently, the FFP complements ITE’s education and career guidance and life skills curriculum. MENDAKI will be expanding the programme to even more ITE students, partnering Polytechnics and the wider youth community. This would include the launch of a Future-Ready Starter Kit in August 2018 on workplace expectations, and strategies to remain relevant in the future economy. With improving educational attainment by Malay students, we have seen a higher proportion of PMETs in the Malay workforce. The proportion of PMETs has increased from one in four in 2007 to one in three in 2017, with a majority in education, health, social services and public administration. Of these, about two thirds are associate professionals and technicians. We also see that Malays have a higher than proportional share of placements under the Adapt and Grow initiative, which includes the career centres run by Workforce Singapore and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute. We want to help our workers and encourage skills upgrading. I have asked Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin to lead a PMET Outreach Committee to create a support network for Malay/Muslim PMETs' retraining and employability needs. The Committee has leveraged on key platforms such as SENSE PMET Jobfair@Grassroots Club and \"Secangkir Kopi bersama MENDAKI\" dialogue and networking session. The Committee produced and distributed more than 3,000 copies of the \"Handy Guidebook for PMETs\" to raise awareness on support schemes. The Committee intends to do more engagements, with 4 \"JUMP! Career Fairs” to offer assistance and raise awareness about growth sectors in Singapore. Sir, as Mr Zaqy Mohamad has highlighted, digitalisation is a key driver of growth in the future economy, and our community must adapt quickly to remain relevant and competitive in this age of disruptive technology. MUIS and MENDAKI have already started using digital tools to improve service delivery and accessibility. For example, MUIS has placed the Asatizah Recognition Scheme, or ARS, procedures online, on the LicenceOne portal to make it easier for registration and to undertake data analytics on the asatizah sector. MENDAKI's Tuition Scheme Online Programme Registration System and Loan Management System have enhanced user convenience and organisation productivity. The data collected through tuition registration enables the team to analyse the profiles of students and their families, and helps us to tailor programmes and outreach according to students' performance. I am pleased to share that MENDAKI has set up a Digital Transformation Department that will help facilitate the digital transformation of our MMOs, so that the community can ultimately benefit. One MMO that has started its digitalisation journey is PPIS. PPIS currently serves about 500 students across seven centres and they want to attract more families with pre-school going children. PPIS is partnering MENDAKI on a data-analytics project to better understand the profiles and needs of client families, so that PPIS can offer higher quality and relevant services. Going digital is vital for our SMEs too. I had the opportunity to engage members of the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or SMCCI. It is heartening to see Malay/Muslim SMEs such as Frozi, an F&B establishment that serves frozen yogurt, and Spear Security Force, a security company, making good progress with their first use of digital solutions to increase revenue and improve productivity. We want to encourage more, if not all, Malay/Muslim SMEs to take that critical first step. We have been working with SME Centre@SMCCI, supported by IMDA's SME Digital Tech Hub, to organise workshops for members. With SMCCI taking the lead to help their members tap on SMEs Go Digital programme, I believe more MM SMEs will come on board. We can also use digital technology to harness the richness of our heritage and culture. Kampong Glam has historically been an open community and welcomes people of different ages and cultures. We want to see if we can enhance the customer and retail experience and transform the overall visitor experience at Kampong Glam. As I mentioned in my MCI COS speech, IMDA is working together with SMCCI, One Kampong Gelam Association, and other partners to create Singapore's first digitally enabled retail neighbourhood. For a start, we will guide Kampong Glam merchants on how they can digitalise themselves to improve their business operations. Today, there are already existing merchants doing so. Take for example, Wardah Bookstore. Wardah sells a wide range of books from Islamic history to philosophy. It actively uses social media, and it has also digitalises its processes so that data accounting is integrated between its physical and online store. The presence of an online store not only directs traffic to the physical store, but boosts its reach to overseas customers in Malaysia and Brunei. Digitalisation will be a key anchor for our community's future growth. This is why I urge our workforce to be future-ready, and our community organisations and SMEs to transform, so that we and our future generations can continue to achieve our hopes and aspirations. Sir, allow me to continue in Malay."

This will certainly close the gap and help these children cope and stay within mainstream education. However, we are also aware of the global shortage of therapists, and Singapore is certainly not spared from this. To this end, how can MCYS ramp up the manpower capacity as soon as possible to extend the outreach beyond the 2,000 children who will benefit under this new programme? 11.30 am In addition, can MCYS provide an update of the Place-and-Train scheme that was announced in October 2011 to allow EIPIC teachers and therapists to be hired ahead of enrolment? Are all our pre-school teachers trained to detect and provide early interventions for children with learning difficulties? We all know every child is precious. Early detection and intervention can certainly improve the child’s chance of progress tremendously. We cannot afford to let any child fall through the cracks. Sir, I would also like to ask if MCYS would be harmonising its programmes with MOE to reach pre-schoolers in kindergartens. Will there be coordinated efforts that will maximise joint resources and expertise and make best use of the limited manpower capacity in this area? In addition, I would like to know if the MCYS is considering instituting a screening process in all pre-schools and childcare centres to detect children with learning difficulties. The recent MCYS' Enabling Masterplan highlighted that there is currently a screening gap between the ages of 18 months and three years in a child’s life. This period is certainly critical to detect developmental disorders for this is when the child develops further in his or her motor, speech and social skills.

They determine the mix of services and programmes in consultation with the residents. Examples include social services, after school care, tuition and other forms of support. I can understand Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's concerns with the local tuition culture. There are many forms of tuition and student guidance services. They range from those providing help to students who need more guidance to keep pace with their school work; to others who are pursuing excellence in some subjects. The range of providers include volunteers helping less privileged students, as well as paid, organised classes. Stopping the conduct of all tuition classes in CCs will remove access to affordable services that some residents and students legitimately need. On the other hand, many other things will need to be done to change the broader tuition culture that Assoc Prof Daniel Goh speaks of. Our communities will have to determine the balance and the type of services that they wish to provide and access at all CCs.</td>\n",

       "2  Madam, community centres (CCs) provide community services to meet the needs of our residents. CCs are managed by local community leaders and volunteers. They determine the mix of services and programmes in consultation with the residents. Examples include social services, after school care, tuition and other forms of support. I can understand Assoc Prof Daniel Goh's concerns with the local tuition culture. There are many forms of tuition and student guidance services. They range from those providing help to students who need more guidance to keep pace with their school work; to others who are pursuing excellence in some subjects. The range of providers include volunteers helping less privileged students, as well as paid, organised classes. Stopping the conduct of all tuition classes in CCs will remove access to affordable services that some residents and students legitimately need. On the other hand, many other things will need to be done to change the broader tuition culture that Assoc Prof Daniel Goh speaks of. Our communities will have to determine the balance and the type of services that they wish to provide and access at all CCs."

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, first, let me declare my interest as a member of the National Youth Council. Douglas MacArthur once said, \"You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt, as young as your self-confidence, and as old as your fear. But when your heart is covered with the snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then and then only are you grown old.\" Mr Chairman, when once we spoke of youth, the word \"apathy\" almost as naturally rolled off the lips of many. It was George Bernard Shaw who also once said, \"Youth is wasted on the young.\" Yet, the image of a laissez-faire apathetic youth is a false one, at least not with the youths I have met, whether it is polytechnic students lobbying for fare concessions, hot-blooded eco-warriors advocating for animal rights or protecting our environment, or the teams of YEC activists quietly serving their communities, reaching out to the less fortunate. And, more importantly for me, the many young workers in the NTUC who have given their time and continue to give their time to serve their fellow workers in the Labour Movement, using their youthful passions to ensure that workers’ rights are defended. Page: 2437 Sir, these and many others are just examples of a small sampling of the endless plethora of causes that young people – young Singaporeans – are engaged with. With the advent of social media, every youth can now count himself as an activist, a campaign manager, an advocate for various causes. We are witnessing, perhaps, a new spring of activism. The groups and organisations may be different from the past but the passions are the same. The generations before us may look at us and say \"Why did we turn out the way we did?\" And, we, too, will look at the generation after and say the same. Yet, each generation will find its own heroes. Each generation will champion its own causes. Amidst this changing youth landscape and rapidly evolving social media whirlpool, the NYC, which saw it genesis in 1989, seems almost arcane with the mushrooming of different animal welfare groups. Even old stalwarts like the SPCA have to compete for attention in an overcrowded space, likewise, the situation for the NYC. As such, there is perhaps no more opportune time than now to ask if the NYC still has a role to play and how this grand dame of youth organisations see itself vis-a-vis other youth organisations. With the multiplication of youth opinion leaders, how then does the MCYS – the Ministry for youths – plan to continue to nurture these budding leaders so that there is a coherent voice? So, perhaps now, this impetuous youth begs to differ from the Nobel Laureate that youths of Singapore are certainly not wasting their time or their youth. My only hope is their hearts will not be filled gradually by pessimism and cynicism. Youth-at-risk: Reaching out My second cut relates to a group of youths where the passions of youth may have led them astray. The Central Youth Guidance Office has played a crucial role since its formation. In Budget 2011, a $1.2 million pilot project called Youth Goal at Northwest CDC was announced. Would the Ministry consider the YGP a potential breakthrough applicable nation-wide? Would this be translated to other constituencies? Concurrent to the YGP, a $1 million investment in the youth information system was also announced to better share database, would the Ministry –</td>\n",

Over the years, I understand that MCCY has announced several initiatives, such as the SG Youth Action Plan and Youth Action Challenge, to actively engage our youths and listen to their views. Can MCCY provide an update the effectiveness of these engagements and what else will be done to engage our youths from diverse backgrounds, so that they can partner with the Government and society to work on hot-button issues and issues that they care about, and to do so on a regular and sustainable basis?\n",

       "2  Mr Chairman, first, let me declare my interest as a member of the National Youth Council. Douglas MacArthur once said, \"You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt, as young as your self-confidence, and as old as your fear. But when your heart is covered with the snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then and then only are you grown old.\" Mr Chairman, when once we spoke of youth, the word \"apathy\" almost as naturally rolled off the lips of many. It was George Bernard Shaw who also once said, \"Youth is wasted on the young.\" Yet, the image of a laissez-faire apathetic youth is a false one, at least not with the youths I have met, whether it is polytechnic students lobbying for fare concessions, hot-blooded eco-warriors advocating for animal rights or protecting our environment, or the teams of YEC activists quietly serving their communities, reaching out to the less fortunate. And, more importantly for me, the many young workers in the NTUC who have given their time and continue to give their time to serve their fellow workers in the Labour Movement, using their youthful passions to ensure that workers’ rights are defended. Page: 2437 Sir, these and many others are just examples of a small sampling of the endless plethora of causes that young people – young Singaporeans – are engaged with. With the advent of social media, every youth can now count himself as an activist, a campaign manager, an advocate for various causes. We are witnessing, perhaps, a new spring of activism. The groups and organisations may be different from the past but the passions are the same. The generations before us may look at us and say \"Why did we turn out the way we did?\" And, we, too, will look at the generation after and say the same. Yet, each generation will find its own heroes. Each generation will champion its own causes. Amidst this changing youth landscape and rapidly evolving social media whirlpool, the NYC, which saw it genesis in 1989, seems almost arcane with the mushrooming of different animal welfare groups. Even old stalwarts like the SPCA have to compete for attention in an overcrowded space, likewise, the situation for the NYC. As such, there is perhaps no more opportune time than now to ask if the NYC still has a role to play and how this grand dame of youth organisations see itself vis-a-vis other youth organisations. With the multiplication of youth opinion leaders, how then does the MCYS – the Ministry for youths – plan to continue to nurture these budding leaders so that there is a coherent voice? So, perhaps now, this impetuous youth begs to differ from the Nobel Laureate that youths of Singapore are certainly not wasting their time or their youth. My only hope is their hearts will not be filled gradually by pessimism and cynicism. Youth-at-risk: Reaching out My second cut relates to a group of youths where the passions of youth may have led them astray. The Central Youth Guidance Office has played a crucial role since its formation. In Budget 2011, a $1.2 million pilot project called Youth Goal at Northwest CDC was announced. Would the Ministry consider the YGP a potential breakthrough applicable nation-wide? Would this be translated to other constituencies? Concurrent to the YGP, a $1 million investment in the youth information system was also announced to better share database, would the Ministry –"

       "      <td>Sir, in 2011, responding to a public query on why an elected opposition Member of Parliament cannot be appointed as grassroots adviser, the PA spokesperson mentioned to a Forum letter, I quote: \"The PA and grassroots organisations gather feedback from the public, explain Government policies and programmes to citizens, and implementing social programmes.\" It was further mentioned that: \"It is not possible to appoint Opposition MPs as advisers because we cannot ask Opposition MPs to help the Government to connect better with the people.\" Another excuse given was \"Nor can PA reasonably expect them to help the Government explain, implement or improve its policies\". Sir, I would like to argue that the current arrangement of appointing the ruling party candidates who contested and were defeated in the general election or any other ruling political party member to be grassroots adviser of a constituency is not right, and the People's Association's reasons for not appointing Opposition Members of Parliament to be grassroots advisors, as cited earlier, does not legitimise the reasons to appoint the two groups of individuals I mentioned earlier. Sir, to address the People's Association's concerns that the roles of grassroots advisers are not suitable for Opposition MPs due to the reasons provided, the People's Association can alternatively appoint a retired or even a current serving civil or public servant of a certain high position, such as Permanent Secretary or statutory board CEO, to be a grassroots adviser. Appointing persons with such reputable civil and public service background and experience is very relevant and much more appropriate, as they are in a better position to explain Government policies and programmes to citizens, implementing social programmes, as well as helping the Government to connect better with the people. Another positive reason for appointing such individuals is that it will help to eliminate or avoid any possibilities of: one, conflict of interest; and, two, politicalisation of the grassroots adviser position, as compared to the current practice of appointing the ruling party's defeated candidates and any other ruling political party members as the grassroots adviser. Sir, I would like to seek the Ministry's agreement on this. Touching on the matter of politicalisation and conflict of interest, I would like to seek answers from the Ministry whether there is, indeed, an element of politicalisation and conflict of interest in the role of grassroots adviser in the following two scenarios. I have cited these scenarios during the recent Public Sector (Governance) Bill to seek some clarification. I was told by Minister Ong Ye Kung to direct the matter to PMO. I submitted this cut under PMO but was redirected to MCCY. First scenario: A member of a political party who contested but was defeated in the general election holds two designations at the same time: one, as the branch chairman of a political party; and, two, as an adviser to People's Association's grassroots organisation. Second scenario: A grassroots adviser conducts house visits accompanied by PA's grassroots leaders and staff of statutory boards, such as the HDB, and inviting residents to attend his Meet-the-People session if residents require him to appeal on their behalf. Nonetheless, the MPS session is held in a political party branch office by the grassroots adviser who writes referral or appeal letters using a political party's letterhead and signs off as the party branch chairman of a political party. Sir, I hope the Ministry will be able to provide clarity and answer.</td>\n",

Minister Chan Chun Sing in his earlier reply on the PA talked about political outreach. I would like to seek clarification from him. PA activities are headed by grassroots advisor, who is a PAP Member of Parliament, and also a prospective PAP candidate, who is also appointed as the grassroots advisor, or previous candidate of PAP heading activities on the ground. Are these activities not considered as political outreach?\n",
       "2  Sir, in 2011, responding to a public query on why an elected opposition Member of Parliament cannot be appointed as grassroots adviser, the PA spokesperson mentioned to a Forum letter, I quote: \"The PA and grassroots organisations gather feedback from the public, explain Government policies and programmes to citizens, and implementing social programmes.\" It was further mentioned that: \"It is not possible to appoint Opposition MPs as advisers because we cannot ask Opposition MPs to help the Government to connect better with the people.\" Another excuse given was \"Nor can PA reasonably expect them to help the Government explain, implement or improve its policies\". Sir, I would like to argue that the current arrangement of appointing the ruling party candidates who contested and were defeated in the general election or any other ruling political party member to be grassroots adviser of a constituency is not right, and the People's Association's reasons for not appointing Opposition Members of Parliament to be grassroots advisors, as cited earlier, does not legitimise the reasons to appoint the two groups of individuals I mentioned earlier. Sir, to address the People's Association's concerns that the roles of grassroots advisers are not suitable for Opposition MPs due to the reasons provided, the People's Association can alternatively appoint a retired or even a current serving civil or public servant of a certain high position, such as Permanent Secretary or statutory board CEO, to be a grassroots adviser. Appointing persons with such reputable civil and public service background and experience is very relevant and much more appropriate, as they are in a better position to explain Government policies and programmes to citizens, implementing social programmes, as well as helping the Government to connect better with the people. Another positive reason for appointing such individuals is that it will help to eliminate or avoid any possibilities of: one, conflict of interest; and, two, politicalisation of the grassroots adviser position, as compared to the current practice of appointing the ruling party's defeated candidates and any other ruling political party members as the grassroots adviser. Sir, I would like to seek the Ministry's agreement on this. Touching on the matter of politicalisation and conflict of interest, I would like to seek answers from the Ministry whether there is, indeed, an element of politicalisation and conflict of interest in the role of grassroots adviser in the following two scenarios. I have cited these scenarios during the recent Public Sector (Governance) Bill to seek some clarification. I was told by Minister Ong Ye Kung to direct the matter to PMO. I submitted this cut under PMO but was redirected to MCCY. First scenario: A member of a political party who contested but was defeated in the general election holds two designations at the same time: one, as the branch chairman of a political party; and, two, as an adviser to People's Association's grassroots organisation. Second scenario: A grassroots adviser conducts house visits accompanied by PA's grassroots leaders and staff of statutory boards, such as the HDB, and inviting residents to attend his Meet-the-People session if residents require him to appeal on their behalf. Nonetheless, the MPS session is held in a political party branch office by the grassroots adviser who writes referral or appeal letters using a political party's letterhead and signs off as the party branch chairman of a political party. Sir, I hope the Ministry will be able to provide clarity and answer."

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, we live in a pluralistic world, and Singapore perhaps more than any other country defines this measure. According to the Religious Diversity Index published by the Pew Research Centre, Singapore ranks first out of 232 countries surveyed with the greatest religious diversity. With diversity comes the vibrancy of our community life – different religious groups celebrating festivals, intermingling of communities and living together in harmony. With diversity also means that fault lines are never too far from the surface which is why Singapore has always been careful in ensuring that these fault lines do not rupture. This means much hard work. We must first recognise that when we talk about religious harmony in Singapore, it is not just skin deep. We have not achieved the harmony simply by talking about how similar we are. All religions, after all, aim for the good of Man, and also acknowledging that we do have differences and accepting those differences. As the society becomes more affluent, correspondingly a sizeable number also turn to greater religious life to find meaning to their lives. We must be careful about how we balance pride and our own faith, and at the same time not denigrate the beliefs of others in the process. I am therefore heartened by President Halimah's announcement of an International Conference on Social Cohesion in December 2018. Having been involved in interreligious dialogue, I am proud that Singapore is often cited as an example of how we can be diverse, yet undivided. Could the Ministry therefore share more details of this conference and what it means for Singapore? How do we promote our way of religious harmony and also learn from the examples of others in challenging the issues of identity politics? Like many Singaporeans, I go to my place of worship regularly. Every Sunday, in church, I see large crowds of fellow believers gathering throughout the entire day. In our mosques, our Muslim brethren throng for Friday prayers. Temples are packed during key festivals as well. We often go about our worship without much thought for safety or security. We take it as a given. Yet we only need to look around us in the region to realise how starkly that religious organisations are obvious soft targets for terrorist attacks. While SGSecure has helped to raise the awareness of the need to be alert and be prepared, are our religious organisations prepared to handle such situations? And who can they turn to seek help to develop or to strengthen their plans. We must always engage each other in dialogue. But it is in showing and experiencing our care for one another that we can truly harmony.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Today, the global environment is more fractious and societies are increasingly polarised. Disruptive technologies are changing our economies, our jobs, our way of life and challenging our norms. Singapore is a global city state that is multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and in some way multinational is at the epicentre of these forces. If we are not careful, these global forces can exert tensions that will threaten, disrupt and test the strength of the fabric of our society. While MCCY has done well in fostering a strong sense of national unity and pride through sectors of arts, youth, community and sports, new challenges such as the COVID-19, regional political turmoil and international trade tensions are always emerging and we must be prepared to remain resilient and stay united as one Singapore. MCCY must continue to strengthen the social fabric and the solidarity in the face of these forces. Are the current MCCY's strategies still relevant in the building an inclusive home where everyone feels that we are equal members of the same community, and are given equal opportunities to thrive and to pursue one's passion and interest? Given the increasing diversity and fractious state of our society, can we continue to progress together as a people? What unites us as one people, one nation? Is it the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave when Singapore Lions beat Pahang during the 1994 Malaysian cup? Or the 50.39 secs that Joseph Schooling swam while we all held our breath in front of our TV screens during the 2016 Olympics? Or the nail-biting table tennis finals during the 2008 Olympics when our paddlers brought us a silver medal? We wept as a nation as we mourned together during the passing of our beloved founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2015. People of all walks of life regarding of race, language or religion came together to queue for hours under the weather, rain or shine, day or night, to pay their last respect. We faced fear and death together during the 2003 SARS crisis which infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Today, we are again tested and challenged and tested with COVID-19. We are tackling these challenges together and collectively with resolute and resilience. As we continue to progress, the natural fault lines in our society – socio-economic divide, racial and religious divide, ideology divide, sexual orientation divide, e-literacy divide and many more – will continue to exist and may surface from time to time to threaten our resolve and unity. Will we be able to rise to the occasion like previous challenges and emerge stronger or will we be divided and withered? MCCY needs to intensify the efforts in building a home that provides opportunities for all. It is important while we embrace our diversity and differences as strength of our nation, we need to work hard to create and expand common spaces and experiences that is unique to Singapore. To do this, I have three suggestions. One, use arts, culture and heritage unique to Singapore. Make of arts and cultural programmes more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans. Similar to the $100 Active SG credits for sports facilities, MCCY can consider giving all Singaporeans $100 Active Arts and Culture credit to attend arts and cultural courses or attend local arts &amp; cultural performances. Two, renew and remake of community clubs to remain relevant so that more Singaporeans will visit and use the CCs. Our CCs should be the Community Centre for arts, culture, wellness and health, social interactions and skills upgrading. Three, expand and build up community sports that can unite and bring people together. Top up the Active SG credits on a regular basis to promote community sports and expand the use of Active credits to sports events attendance, including our SG football leagues and national sports events. Chairman, building a home that provide opportunities for all is not just an ideal. It is a reality. It is a basic right for all Singaporeans. I would like to thank MCCY for their hard work and invite all Singaporeans from all walks of life to join MCCY to make this arduous task a reality. Question proposed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions to our economy and how we live our lives. To make things worse, we witnessed insensitive misinformation propagated on media platforms threatening to strain our societal fault lines and heighten the tension that the pandemic already caused us. However, I am heartened that my fellow Singaporeans have risen to the occasion. Singaporeans rallied around one another to keep each other safe. We have read and seen heart-warming acts of ordinary Singaporeans giving out free masks, placing hand sanitisers in lifts, neighbours helping one another to deliver groceries, free food in appreciation of healthcare workers and more. Donation collections also increased for some charities, despite the challenging circumstances. These self-initiated acts of kindness demonstrate the good in our people and reflect the strong foundation of our social values. Contrast these with the irrational acts of violence targeting Asian communities in the West; ranging from assaulting elderly Asians on the streets, vandalising businesses operated by Asians to calling for Asians to be deported. We cannot let any form of prejudice and discrimination poison our society. Our diverse and harmonious society today is hard earned and too precious to lose. On this note, I would like to ask two questions. First, what are the Government’s strategies in strengthening Singapore’s cohesion and resilience so that all Singaporeans can forge ahead together as one? Second, how will the Ministry strengthen its effort in bridging the different segments of our diverse society? Sir, it is important that we press on with our efforts to galvanise our communities and rally them into action. To quote Mother Theresa, “I can do things you cannot, you can do things I cannot; together we can do great things”. And together, we will emerge stronger.</td>\n",

According to the Religious Diversity Index published by the Pew Research Centre, Singapore ranks first out of 232 countries surveyed with the greatest religious diversity. With diversity comes the vibrancy of our community life – different religious groups celebrating festivals, intermingling of communities and living together in harmony. With diversity also means that fault lines are never too far from the surface which is why Singapore has always been careful in ensuring that these fault lines do not rupture. This means much hard work. We must first recognise that when we talk about religious harmony in Singapore, it is not just skin deep. We have not achieved the harmony simply by talking about how similar we are. All religions, after all, aim for the good of Man, and also acknowledging that we do have differences and accepting those differences. As the society becomes more affluent, correspondingly a sizeable number also turn to greater religious life to find meaning to their lives. We must be careful about how we balance pride and our own faith, and at the same time not denigrate the beliefs of others in the process. I am therefore heartened by President Halimah's announcement of an International Conference on Social Cohesion in December 2018. Having been involved in interreligious dialogue, I am proud that Singapore is often cited as an example of how we can be diverse, yet undivided. Could the Ministry therefore share more details of this conference and what it means for Singapore? How do we promote our way of religious harmony and also learn from the examples of others in challenging the issues of identity politics? Like many Singaporeans, I go to my place of worship regularly. Every Sunday, in church, I see large crowds of fellow believers gathering throughout the entire day. In our mosques, our Muslim brethren throng for Friday prayers. Temples are packed during key festivals as well. We often go about our worship without much thought for safety or security. We take it as a given. Yet we only need to look around us in the region to realise how starkly that religious organisations are obvious soft targets for terrorist attacks. While SGSecure has helped to raise the awareness of the need to be alert and be prepared, are our religious organisations prepared to handle such situations? And who can they turn to seek help to develop or to strengthen their plans. We must always engage each other in dialogue. But it is in showing and experiencing our care for one another that we can truly harmony.\n",
       "1  Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Today, the global environment is more fractious and societies are increasingly polarised. Disruptive technologies are changing our economies, our jobs, our way of life and challenging our norms. Singapore is a global city state that is multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and in some way multinational is at the epicentre of these forces. If we are not careful, these global forces can exert tensions that will threaten, disrupt and test the strength of the fabric of our society. While MCCY has done well in fostering a strong sense of national unity and pride through sectors of arts, youth, community and sports, new challenges such as the COVID-19, regional political turmoil and international trade tensions are always emerging and we must be prepared to remain resilient and stay united as one Singapore. MCCY must continue to strengthen the social fabric and the solidarity in the face of these forces. Are the current MCCY's strategies still relevant in the building an inclusive home where everyone feels that we are equal members of the same community, and are given equal opportunities to thrive and to pursue one's passion and interest? Given the increasing diversity and fractious state of our society, can we continue to progress together as a people? What unites us as one people, one nation? Is it the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave when Singapore Lions beat Pahang during the 1994 Malaysian cup? Or the 50.39 secs that Joseph Schooling swam while we all held our breath in front of our TV screens during the 2016 Olympics? Or the nail-biting table tennis finals during the 2008 Olympics when our paddlers brought us a silver medal? We wept as a nation as we mourned together during the passing of our beloved founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2015. People of all walks of life regarding of race, language or religion came together to queue for hours under the weather, rain or shine, day or night, to pay their last respect. We faced fear and death together during the 2003 SARS crisis which infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Today, we are again tested and challenged and tested with COVID-19. We are tackling these challenges together and collectively with resolute and resilience. As we continue to progress, the natural fault lines in our society – socio-economic divide, racial and religious divide, ideology divide, sexual orientation divide, e-literacy divide and many more – will continue to exist and may surface from time to time to threaten our resolve and unity. Will we be able to rise to the occasion like previous challenges and emerge stronger or will we be divided and withered? MCCY needs to intensify the efforts in building a home that provides opportunities for all. It is important while we embrace our diversity and differences as strength of our nation, we need to work hard to create and expand common spaces and experiences that is unique to Singapore. To do this, I have three suggestions. One, use arts, culture and heritage unique to Singapore. Make of arts and cultural programmes more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans. Similar to the $100 Active SG credits for sports facilities, MCCY can consider giving all Singaporeans $100 Active Arts and Culture credit to attend arts and cultural courses or attend local arts & cultural performances. Two, renew and remake of community clubs to remain relevant so that more Singaporeans will visit and use the CCs. Our CCs should be the Community Centre for arts, culture, wellness and health, social interactions and skills upgrading. Three, expand and build up community sports that can unite and bring people together. Top up the Active SG credits on a regular basis to promote community sports and expand the use of Active credits to sports events attendance, including our SG football leagues and national sports events. Chairman, building a home that provide opportunities for all is not just an ideal. It is a reality. It is a basic right for all Singaporeans. I would like to thank MCCY for their hard work and invite all Singaporeans from all walks of life to join MCCY to make this arduous task a reality. Question proposed.\n",

To make things worse, we witnessed insensitive misinformation propagated on media platforms threatening to strain our societal fault lines and heighten the tension that the pandemic already caused us. However, I am heartened that my fellow Singaporeans have risen to the occasion. Singaporeans rallied around one another to keep each other safe. We have read and seen heart-warming acts of ordinary Singaporeans giving out free masks, placing hand sanitisers in lifts, neighbours helping one another to deliver groceries, free food in appreciation of healthcare workers and more. Donation collections also increased for some charities, despite the challenging circumstances. These self-initiated acts of kindness demonstrate the good in our people and reflect the strong foundation of our social values. Contrast these with the irrational acts of violence targeting Asian communities in the West; ranging from assaulting elderly Asians on the streets, vandalising businesses operated by Asians to calling for Asians to be deported. We cannot let any form of prejudice and discrimination poison our society. Our diverse and harmonious society today is hard earned and too precious to lose. On this note, I would like to ask two questions. First, what are the Government’s strategies in strengthening Singapore’s cohesion and resilience so that all Singaporeans can forge ahead together as one? Second, how will the Ministry strengthen its effort in bridging the different segments of our diverse society? Sir, it is important that we press on with our efforts to galvanise our communities and rally them into action. To quote Mother Theresa, “I can do things you cannot, you can do things I cannot; together we can do great things”. And together, we will emerge stronger."

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, without the support from the community, the reach and impact of our programmes in uplifting the vulnerable will be limited. Our volunteers play an important role in reaching out to families to understand their concerns, conducting needs assessment and befriending them. Many of our volunteers have displayed empathy, patience and resilience. I thank all our M3 volunteers, who have dedicated timeless support for the families. They have been tirelesly helping these families work and walk the journey to achieve their aspirations. To expand our network of care, especially to the families with children aged six years and below living in public rental flats, we need more volunteers to come forward to support us in this effort. We need volunteers who can inspire hope in families, engage them regularly over an extended period of time, thereby building rapport and trust with them. I encourage more from the community to step forward and contribute in whatever way they can. We will ensure that all M3 volunteers are equipped with the right knowledge and skillset to meaningfully engage families through the Volunteers Capability Building Framework. So far, more than 150 volunteers have attended our onboarding programme last year and about 120 volunteers have attended the basic house visit workshops. Despite restrictions during COVID-19, our M3@Towns have done well serving the community. A total of 77 initiatives were conducted by 11 M3@Towns last year, benefiting more than 53,000 residents. Our M3@Towns also supported residents through ground-up initiatives such as the \"Jom Surf!\" – \"Jom\", Melayu word for \"Come\" – which equips our seniors with digital literacy. With guidance from our young volunteers, seniors built their confidence in using technology by learning how to use WhatsApp, Singpass and TraceTogether app. I attended one of these sessions recently and was heartened to see the enthusiasm of both our young volunteers and our senior learners. We bridged the digital gap and the generational gap at the same time. We will be organising another edition of the M3 Forum in the first half of next year after the last session in 2020, to bring together volunteers across various towns and programmes to network, and share ideas and best practices. Mr Chairman, we will continue our efforts to strengthen our programmes and outreach to targeted segments – our children, our families and the community – to build up their competencies and empower them to achieve their aspirations. This spirit of caring for one another binds us together and we will leave no one behind as we build our Community of Success.</td>\n",

       "0  Mr Chairman, without the support from the community, the reach and impact of our programmes in uplifting the vulnerable will be limited. Our volunteers play an important role in reaching out to families to understand their concerns, conducting needs assessment and befriending them. Many of our volunteers have displayed empathy, patience and resilience. I thank all our M3 volunteers, who have dedicated timeless support for the families. They have been tirelesly helping these families work and walk the journey to achieve their aspirations. To expand our network of care, especially to the families with children aged six years and below living in public rental flats, we need more volunteers to come forward to support us in this effort. We need volunteers who can inspire hope in families, engage them regularly over an extended period of time, thereby building rapport and trust with them. I encourage more from the community to step forward and contribute in whatever way they can. We will ensure that all M3 volunteers are equipped with the right knowledge and skillset to meaningfully engage families through the Volunteers Capability Building Framework. So far, more than 150 volunteers have attended our onboarding programme last year and about 120 volunteers have attended the basic house visit workshops. Despite restrictions during COVID-19, our M3@Towns have done well serving the community. A total of 77 initiatives were conducted by 11 M3@Towns last year, benefiting more than 53,000 residents. Our M3@Towns also supported residents through ground-up initiatives such as the \"Jom Surf!\" – \"Jom\", Melayu word for \"Come\" – which equips our seniors with digital literacy. With guidance from our young volunteers, seniors built their confidence in using technology by learning how to use WhatsApp, Singpass and TraceTogether app. I attended one of these sessions recently and was heartened to see the enthusiasm of both our young volunteers and our senior learners. We bridged the digital gap and the generational gap at the same time. We will be organising another edition of the M3 Forum in the first half of next year after the last session in 2020, to bring together volunteers across various towns and programmes to network, and share ideas and best practices. Mr Chairman, we will continue our efforts to strengthen our programmes and outreach to targeted segments – our children, our families and the community – to build up their competencies and empower them to achieve their aspirations. This spirit of caring for one another binds us together and we will leave no one behind as we build our Community of Success.\n",

We have witnessed individuals, businesses, and the community step up, came together to organise ground-up initiatives to assist those in need. Just like in Woodgrove, where residents grassroots volunteers and our community partners, such as schools, VWOs as well as Northwest CDC, came together and lived up to the spirit of ‘From the Community, For the Community’ by organising care pack distribution drives for the vulnerable groups as well as food delivery riders within our community. How will MCCY sustain this spirit of care? What are the Ministry’s plans to encourage more individuals, such as our youths, our corporations to step forward to work closely with the relevant agencies and other community partners to contribute and leave a positive impact to our community?"

This is a 44% increase in three years. Although the numbers seem small, I believe the reports are only the tip of the iceberg, as it is very embarrassing for many women to cry out in a crowded train and claim she was molested in front of everyone. Molesters get away with their crime most easily when trains are packed during peak hours, with people standing very close to each other. I doubt the current attempts at public education are working. The National Crime Prevention Council's posters in public transport showing a male attempting to molest a woman from behind and asking women to protect themselves may be backfiring. Internationally, such anti-crime campaigns and posters have been criticised for putting the onus on women to prevent the crime and promoting a culture of blaming the victim for the crime. I urge the Minister to mandate the MRT service providers to have prominent signs on the floor and the doors, and within the cabins, to designate specific cabin as for women only. Many train stations now have wardens on duty to guide peak hour traffic. The wardens could tell the men to move to other cabins. Japan and Taiwan have implemented women only cabin with success. Although not all women will choose to take these cabins, but at least, those who feel vulnerable or have had bad experiences will have the option of travelling to work and back home to their families with peace of mind.

       "      <td>Madam, the spate of vandals breaking onto trains at Bishan Depot causes much concern. From May 2010, there have been four incidents of such break-ins detected at MRT depots, the latest in November last year. This was despite various security measures being employed by SMRT and re-assurances given in this House since 2010 about the comprehensive security review being undertaken by the Public Transport Security Committee to address security gaps in our entire transport system. Are these measures working? Just last month, on 27 February, train services were stopped briefly in the evening as a result of a man walking on the viaduct between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations. Madam, we have been extremely lucky that the security breaches so far involve graffiti artists rather than terrorists. We were told in Parliament in 2010 that the current security framework was that PTOs where the primary responsibility for day-to-day operational security and are placed to decide which measures are the most feasible. We were also told that the Government sets security standards and also does security audits. It is thus worrying that despite the specific concern about depot security being flagged out in 2010, it seems that certain vulnerabilities of Bishan Depot were only attended to in 2014 after two intrusions there. Why was this not picked up earlier? The Minister has announced that the LTA will introduce new security-related standards within the operating performance standards for PTOs. Failure to comply will attract penalties up to $1 million or 10% of the licensee's annual fare revenue of the affected rail system whichever is higher. The next breach may not be by a graffiti artist but by a terrorist and a fine of $1 million then will be too little and too late compared to the grave consequences of a terrorist attack. Is it time for the Government to be more proactive in assisting the PTOs to enhance security?</td>\n",

       "2  Madam, the spate of vandals breaking onto trains at Bishan Depot causes much concern. From May 2010, there have been four incidents of such break-ins detected at MRT depots, the latest in November last year. This was despite various security measures being employed by SMRT and re-assurances given in this House since 2010 about the comprehensive security review being undertaken by the Public Transport Security Committee to address security gaps in our entire transport system. Are these measures working? Just last month, on 27 February, train services were stopped briefly in the evening as a result of a man walking on the viaduct between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations. Madam, we have been extremely lucky that the security breaches so far involve graffiti artists rather than terrorists. We were told in Parliament in 2010 that the current security framework was that PTOs where the primary responsibility for day-to-day operational security and are placed to decide which measures are the most feasible. We were also told that the Government sets security standards and also does security audits. It is thus worrying that despite the specific concern about depot security being flagged out in 2010, it seems that certain vulnerabilities of Bishan Depot were only attended to in 2014 after two intrusions there. Why was this not picked up earlier? The Minister has announced that the LTA will introduce new security-related standards within the operating performance standards for PTOs. Failure to comply will attract penalties up to $1 million or 10% of the licensee's annual fare revenue of the affected rail system whichever is higher. The next breach may not be by a graffiti artist but by a terrorist and a fine of $1 million then will be too little and too late compared to the grave consequences of a terrorist attack. Is it time for the Government to be more proactive in assisting the PTOs to enhance security?"

       "1  I do agree with the Minister that the Tribunal will be the last resort and we should try to avoid that if possible. But I want to ask the Minister whether this adjudication approach is the only way to compel the resident to behaviour or act, or are there other ways like the enforcement approach where we can have specific penalty issued by maybe the Police or the HDB officers, or even demerit points systems that some jurisdictions have. In Hong Kong, they have demerit points for households and so on. So, whether we want to look also at the enforcement approach. Going into adjudication will be really the last resort. The neighbour disputes can be resolved but there will never be neighbourliness between them. Secondly, it appears that a minority of the residents still are not conscious of what constitutes anti-social behaviour or socially irresponsible behaviour. On that front, whether the MCCY will want to step up on the education and publicity, especially when the new residents move into the flats, and so on, will conduct themselves in a socially responsible way.\n",

As part of my work on the ground, I have encountered young women at different stages of their relationships. Some were teen moms, some were struggling to find a job and others found it difficult to balance the responsibilities of a new wife.

Her email struck me as I realised that both she and I, had gotten married at about the same time.

In addition, due to the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19, how can the programme be better supported for online outreach, and given the diversity of the couples, is it possible to consider customisable modules to cater for the different needs and demographics of couples who may require more targeted support?

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" Before I begin, let me wish all the ladies here \"Happy Women's Day\". Our Nation, Singapore is a young country. We are celebrating our 54th National day this August. The task of nation building is an endless one. It is one that needs all Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion to come together, rally together as one united people and one nation. We come together to celebrate every success Singapore achieved, to celebrate our uniquely Singaporean culture, food, arts and sports. It only seems like not so long ago when young Singaporean were thought to be politically and socially apathetic. Yet today, we have an increasingly mature citizenry with a diverse array of views and hopes for their own future, and for the future of Singapore. These can be attributed to a society with growing literacy and affluence, where they are able to take the focus off from bread and butter issues to other matters and issues that affect their lives. The widespread use of social media certainly helps them and rallies them in expressing their views. And, the Government needs to do more to engage and partner Singaporeans in the next exciting phase of nation building. Our youths and our older Singaporeans who have found common ground have bandied together and created groups to promote their causes. They participate in forums and focus group discussions. They are vocal on social media, some are more sophisticated with their analyses and feedback, others less so. But it is evident that many Singaporeans would like to have an active role in nation-building and shaping the future. Some expressed their views through arts, music and culture. However, some are unsure of the available avenues, or lack the capability to do so. MCCY has been taking the lead in ensuring that citizens are actively involved in our nation building, in policy deliberation and design. Online feedback portals, community outreach events, facilitation of networking events for stakeholders and volunteers to come together are some examples of ways in which Singaporeans can engage in nation-building. Nevertheless, majority of the engagement feels top-down, in the sense that citizens provide feedback, and Government works on it. We need to move away from a top down approach to a less paternalistic approach. The Government need to create more space, room and opportunities for Singaporeans to participate. For those who are ready to do more, particularly Singaporeans with leadership qualities, good ethics and are socially well-connected, they should have more opportunities to participate. They could create social projects and lead teams of volunteers. For those who are not ready, perhaps they lack comprehension of policies, or skills to articulate their aspirations and feedback, and we must help them to grow their capability. This can be done through giving them access to the necessary information, and the skills to participate. Many Singaporeans still find certain policies to be too complex to understand and they do not get why certain policies have to be this way. If the Ministry could come up with more creative means to break down these policies for the layman, that would be helpful. It is prudent that all citizens in Singapore have a stake in nation-building, to ensure equality and for everyone’s interests to be cared for. Our population has always been and will always be our best resource, and with a more well-informed population, there will be more and better possibilities. As we face more complex issues, we will be able to tap on the collective wisdom and expertise of our citizenry. There is strength in numbers; as we build Singapore together, we can work towards creating the best Singapore that we can, one that all citizens have a stake in. I would like to ask how will the Ministry continue engaging citizens in nation-building? How can we raise the commitment levels towards building a Singaporean society where everyone can continue to be proud of our country and its achievements? Question proposed.</td>\n",

       "488  Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" Before I begin, let me wish all the ladies here \"Happy Women's Day\". Our Nation, Singapore is a young country. We are celebrating our 54th National day this August. The task of nation building is an endless one. It is one that needs all Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion to come together, rally together as one united people and one nation. We come together to celebrate every success Singapore achieved, to celebrate our uniquely Singaporean culture, food, arts and sports. It only seems like not so long ago when young Singaporean were thought to be politically and socially apathetic. Yet today, we have an increasingly mature citizenry with a diverse array of views and hopes for their own future, and for the future of Singapore. These can be attributed to a society with growing literacy and affluence, where they are able to take the focus off from bread and butter issues to other matters and issues that affect their lives. The widespread use of social media certainly helps them and rallies them in expressing their views. And, the Government needs to do more to engage and partner Singaporeans in the next exciting phase of nation building. Our youths and our older Singaporeans who have found common ground have bandied together and created groups to promote their causes. They participate in forums and focus group discussions. They are vocal on social media, some are more sophisticated with their analyses and feedback, others less so. But it is evident that many Singaporeans would like to have an active role in nation-building and shaping the future. Some expressed their views through arts, music and culture. However, some are unsure of the available avenues, or lack the capability to do so. MCCY has been taking the lead in ensuring that citizens are actively involved in our nation building, in policy deliberation and design. Online feedback portals, community outreach events, facilitation of networking events for stakeholders and volunteers to come together are some examples of ways in which Singaporeans can engage in nation-building. Nevertheless, majority of the engagement feels top-down, in the sense that citizens provide feedback, and Government works on it. We need to move away from a top down approach to a less paternalistic approach. The Government need to create more space, room and opportunities for Singaporeans to participate. For those who are ready to do more, particularly Singaporeans with leadership qualities, good ethics and are socially well-connected, they should have more opportunities to participate. They could create social projects and lead teams of volunteers. For those who are not ready, perhaps they lack comprehension of policies, or skills to articulate their aspirations and feedback, and we must help them to grow their capability. This can be done through giving them access to the necessary information, and the skills to participate. Many Singaporeans still find certain policies to be too complex to understand and they do not get why certain policies have to be this way. If the Ministry could come up with more creative means to break down these policies for the layman, that would be helpful. It is prudent that all citizens in Singapore have a stake in nation-building, to ensure equality and for everyone’s interests to be cared for. Our population has always been and will always be our best resource, and with a more well-informed population, there will be more and better possibilities. As we face more complex issues, we will be able to tap on the collective wisdom and expertise of our citizenry. There is strength in numbers; as we build Singapore together, we can work towards creating the best Singapore that we can, one that all citizens have a stake in. I would like to ask how will the Ministry continue engaging citizens in nation-building? How can we raise the commitment levels towards building a Singaporean society where everyone can continue to be proud of our country and its achievements? Question proposed.   \n",

Madrasah institutions have an illustrious tradition. They are important in equipping generations of azatizahs with a firm foundation in both secular and religious subjects. These azatizahs are our community assets and we are very proud of them. It is critical that we ensure madrasah students and teachers in Singapore continue to receive ample support and opportunities to fulfil their potential. What is being done to enhance our madrasahs so that they can continue to produce good quality graduates and continue its illustrious tradition? The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.   \n",

       "      <td>Sir, the local arts scene has grown much more robust and vibrant in the recent years. This is heartening. The 2016 statistics from the Ministry indicate that more Singaporeans are taking an active interest in arts and culture, enjoying museums, performing arts and visual art activities. The keen interest can be seen in both ticketed, as well as free events. The number of arts and cultural companies and arts societies has also been increasing lately. The data from MCCY is a useful indicator that our arts scene is indeed growing, but certainly, there is more to it than numbers. I would like to ask the Minister for an update on how the arts scene has developed over the last few years, especially since in Budget 2014, MCCY has set aside an additional $20 million over five years to promote our artists, unique heritage, as well as cultural assets overseas. How effectively have these funds been utilised and how has this helped to develop our local arts creators? Moving forward, what strategies will be employed to further develop our arts scene? Can the Minister share the plans to enhance engagement and education in relation to arts, especially for youth and children? Art enlivens our community, as well as outdoor spaces, and creates shared memories for Singapore. Displaying art in public brings it closer to the people, eradicating the notion that art is only for a specific group of people. From the heartlands, places of interest, business and shopping districts to the MRT stations, it has become a common sight to see local artists and tourists whipping out their phones to take photographs, as well as people waiting by these art pieces which they have now embraced as landmarks. More importantly, several of all these art pieces are commissioned to local artists, making public spaces an ideal platform to gain exposure. The various free guide trails deserve more awareness as they are perfect opportunities to instil knowledge on heritage and culture to Singaporeans. Can MCCY update on the Public Art Trust? Are there plans to bring arts to more spaces? The rise of the \"gig economy\" brings about many exciting opportunities for freelancers who aspire to be their own boss, pick their own projects and work flexible hours. In reality, the situation is not always rosy for the majority. Aside from the lack of a stable income, freelancers grapple with a myriad of legal and administrative challenges. Last year’s results of the Graduate Employment Survey indicated that there is an increase in freelance and part-time jobs being evident among graduates from courses in the arts and humanities. This would largely be attributed to the nature of their work, which is mostly project-based and spans across a specific duration. The Government has introduced measures to help this group of freelancers. The Work Mentorship Programme by WSQ aims to give junior creative freelancers a head start through hands-on-training and mentorship with companies. This is a good scheme in principle. I would like to ask how has the response been from participants, and what can be done to enhance the scheme? Last year, a free handbook was also launched to educate and inform creative freelancers about their legal rights. Thus far, how effective has been in mitigating the problems that freelancers face from errant clients? The gig economy is fast becoming a global trend. We can only expect more creative freelancers to enter the industry, whether by choice or by circumstances. What is the Government doing to increase support for freelancers within the arts industry?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sir, physical venues like the museums and art theatres were forced to close and events were suspended at the peak of the pandemic last year. Consequently, many local arts and culture practitioners were hit swiftly and severely. The Government's broad-based support measures and the Arts and Culture Resilience Package would have helped to provide some buoyancy but it remained challenging. Thankfully, many of them were nimble enough to pivot onto the digital platform, applying their creativity in times of adversity. As consumers increasingly get used to digital content and experience, digital and blended delivery models will remain relevant post-COVID-19. It is, therefore, crucial for the sector to continue developing its digital capabilities to remain competitive. Such capabilities help local arts and culture products to transcend physical boundaries and reach further. In this regard, I applaud the launch of the #SGCultureAnywhere campaign by the National Arts Council, as it offers a platform for practitioners to make their work a lot more accessible. I would like to ask the Ministry for an update on the uptake of the Digital Presentation Grant for the Arts. Also, how does the Ministry intend to support the sector to adopt more digital solutions and experiment to create digital arts and culture products that can be scaled to reach a wider audience? Picasso said, \"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\" We must, therefore, continue to make art available and accessible. Going digital is essential in the new era post-COVID-19.</td>\n",

With limited land space in Singapore, there are not many places that can be used for arts groups. I hope we could do the following: First, Government Ministries can engage in inter-Ministerial discussions on how to increase space allocated for culture and arts. Second, during the current COVID-19 outbreak, I hope that we can consider granting rental rebates to arts groups, so that they can focus on rehearsals as usual, and not lose the drive to perform due to loss of income because of cancellation of performances. My wish is that the dance will continue, the music will not stop playing, and we can live life as per normal.</td>\n",

The Work Mentorship Programme by WSQ aims to give junior creative freelancers a head start through hands-on-training and mentorship with companies. This is a good scheme in principle. I would like to ask how has the response been from participants, and what can be done to enhance the scheme? Last year, a free handbook was also launched to educate and inform creative freelancers about their legal rights. Thus far, how effective has been in mitigating the problems that freelancers face from errant clients? The gig economy is fast becoming a global trend. We can only expect more creative freelancers to enter the industry, whether by choice or by circumstances. What is the Government doing to increase support for freelancers within the arts industry?\n",

Consequently, many local arts and culture practitioners were hit swiftly and severely. The Government's broad-based support measures and the Arts and Culture Resilience Package would have helped to provide some buoyancy but it remained challenging. Thankfully, many of them were nimble enough to pivot onto the digital platform, applying their creativity in times of adversity. As consumers increasingly get used to digital content and experience, digital and blended delivery models will remain relevant post-COVID-19. It is, therefore, crucial for the sector to continue developing its digital capabilities to remain competitive. Such capabilities help local arts and culture products to transcend physical boundaries and reach further. In this regard, I applaud the launch of the #SGCultureAnywhere campaign by the National Arts Council, as it offers a platform for practitioners to make their work a lot more accessible. I would like to ask the Ministry for an update on the uptake of the Digital Presentation Grant for the Arts. Also, how does the Ministry intend to support the sector to adopt more digital solutions and experiment to create digital arts and culture products that can be scaled to reach a wider audience? Picasso said, \"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\" We must, therefore, continue to make art available and accessible. Going digital is essential in the new era post-COVID-19.\n",

With limited land space in Singapore, there are not many places that can be used for arts groups. I hope we could do the following: First, Government Ministries can engage in inter-Ministerial discussions on how to increase space allocated for culture and arts. Second, during the current COVID-19 outbreak, I hope that we can consider granting rental rebates to arts groups, so that they can focus on rehearsals as usual, and not lose the drive to perform due to loss of income because of cancellation of performances. My wish is that the dance will continue, the music will not stop playing, and we can live life as per normal."

Second, will the Minister assure that there will continue to be a careful mix of programmes such that there will not just be programmes catering to a certain demographic of youths, but there will be platforms whereby youths of different interests and background can come together and get to know one another more?

It is more important than ever that our youth learn more about the region, instead of looking only at the traditional markets like the West and China. What are the Ministry's plans to strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties within ASEAN during Singapore's Chairmanship year? Does MCCY plan to use this opportunity as ASEAN Chair to help integrate our youth with the ASEAN community, and to get our youth to feel more to think ASEAN? How can we encourage our youth to further explore the opportunities available to them in ASEAN, and to experience all the cultures and experiences that ASEAN neighbours can offer? I also hope for our youth also get the chance to see the economic dynamism and opportunities within ASEAN.

First, is on alumni. I would like to ask the Minister how will his Ministry directly or indirectly continue to engage the alumni. Development is a continuum and not in a discrete manner such that after they have graduated from the programmes, they continue to be active in the volunteering scene or in the community. Second, will the Minister assure that there will continue to be a careful mix of programmes such that there will not just be programmes catering to a certain demographic of youths, but there will be platforms whereby youths of different interests and background can come together and get to know one another more? The third and last point, I would like to ask the Minister what is the definition of success for youth programmes and engagement?\n",
       "1  Chairman, during the Budget debate, I spoke about getting our youth to think ASEAN. It is important for Singapore, especially our youth to understand, network and integrate with other ASEAN countries, given ASEAN's rising economic force and driver of global growth. It is more important than ever that our youth learn more about the region, instead of looking only at the traditional markets like the West and China. What are the Ministry's plans to strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties within ASEAN during Singapore's Chairmanship year? Does MCCY plan to use this opportunity as ASEAN Chair to help integrate our youth with the ASEAN community, and to get our youth to feel more to think ASEAN? How can we encourage our youth to further explore the opportunities available to them in ASEAN, and to experience all the cultures and experiences that ASEAN neighbours can offer? I also hope for our youth also get the chance to see the economic dynamism and opportunities within ASEAN. Lastly, is there more that MCCY can do to work together with MTI and MOE, through a whole-of-Government approach, to shift our youth's mindset to think ASEAN?\n",

       "      <td>I have two questions. One is for Minister Yaacob Ibrahim and one for Minister Chan Chun Sing. For Minister Yaacob Ibrahim, I would like to ask regarding the announcement made by Minister about MUIS rendering financial assistance to help Madrasah Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiyah (MWTI) with the payment of the land lease. Firstly, I have to declare that I have a child who is schooling in Madrasah Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiyah. So, I just want to know, by accepting this assistance, what are the terms and conditions that are placed upon MWTI by MUIS, for example is MWTI required to join the Joint Madrasah System? Secondly, are members of the MWTI management board to be appointed by MUIS from henceforth, if yes, how many of the members? For Minister Chan Chun Sing, my speech is to ask for clarification, it is not about asking or clarifying about whether any Government agencies accept letters written by any political parties' members. The Minister mentioned Mr Leon Perera, who is also a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament. My question is about the issue of politicisation and conflict of interest where a particular grassroots advisor goes for the house visits, invites the people to come to his Meet-the-People session, which is being held in a political party branch office and the letter written on behalf of the residents is signed off by this particular person who holds two designations: grassroots advisor and political party branch chairman. And, the letterhead being used for this appeal letter bears the name of the political party. So, I just want to know, from Minister's point of view, is there any element of politicisation as well as conflict of interest in this particular example that I have mentioned. I would like to give one more example, so hopefully Minister can give a direct answer to this.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chairman, the disruption to our economy from the pandemic has had different impact on various segments of our country. COVID-19 has inflicted disproportionate hardship upon those who are less well-off and pushed those at the margins into further difficulties. To make matters worse, rampant misinformation on the internet and social media platforms is adding to the turbulence. Our world is under many stresses and these have the potential to deepen societal divisions, especially those along religious and racial fault lines. There is much work to be done to narrow the gaps. We need to foster a cohesive and caring society in order to recover and forge ahead as one nation. Would MCCY share its strategies on how it will work with Singaporeans to close ranks and become a more united and resilient people? How will the Government ensure that in our fight against the pandemic and consequent chaos, no one is left behind? One of my greatest concerns is the state of racial and religious harmony in Singapore. It is threatened by radicalisation of troubled individuals and groups. The most recent case was that of a 16-year-old student of Protestant faith who plotted to attack two mosques and kill Muslim worshippers here. A few churches in my constituency reached out to the Masjid Jamek Queenstown, also in my division, for a sharing and meal together as an expression of solidarity, to deepen the ties between both faiths and condemned the incident. Strengthening religious harmony is an on-going work in progress. We are one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world. Mutual respect and tolerance are qualities that we must all conscientiously nurture and practice, and teach our young. I commend MCCY for its work to build up religious tolerance among our people and look forward to hearing its new initiatives. I propose MCCY facilitating regular sharing sessions among our different faiths which is key to building trust and understanding. Similarly, we need to put in effort to encourage Singaporeans to do their part to build racial harmony. The more we interact with members of different racial communities, the better we can understand one another and learn that in fact, we have so much more in common than differences. What is exciting for me is that there is much wisdom we can gather from those who are different from us. Would MCCY share the projects and initiatives it has in store to further enhance our racial harmony? One of the silver linings from the COVID-19 pandemic is how it ignited the spirit of “gotong royong” in our society. There are various interpretations and translations for this phrase, including “active citizenry”, “cooperation in a community” and “mutual aid”. My favorite is “carrying burdens together” because gotong means \"carrying a burden using one's shoulder\" and royong means \"together\" or \"communally\". Carrying burdens together implies a willingness to help another lighten his load. It means stepping forward to volunteer and lend a helping hand. During this crisis, many individuals, businesses and community groups have indeed stepped up. They voluntarily contributed time, energy and money to organise their own ground-up initiatives to assist those in need. This outpouring of selflessness brought strangers and the community together in a common cause. I am heartened and inspired by the efforts of our people to work together for the benefit of our community. I earnestly hope that we will be able to continue the momentum and sustain this spirit of mutual care, trust and understanding. Even as we are helping the needy, we are simultaneously building bonds across religious, racial and cultural boundaries, and learning more about ourselves and our Singapore identity. A student volunteer shared how he would never look at a packet of food the same way again after helping to distribute packets of meals to some needy families. Coming from a very comfortable background, it was hard for him to visualise food insecurity in our bustling city. His experience as a volunteer had been an eye opener and strengthened his resolve to be more involved in the community. How is MCCY encouraging more individuals from all walks of life, including youths, as well as corporates, to step forward, volunteer and contribute to make a positive impact? I would like to suggest that the Ministry facilitate regular meetups for volunteers of cause-based programmes to share their experiences, challenges, pains, high points, hopes and more. Each one of us has a different takeaway from our volunteering experiences. Such sharing and interactive sessions will be helpful for bonding and motivating one another to stay involved and keep going. Otherwise, some of them may feel alone along the volunteering journey and drop off. On the other hand, if they enjoy the volunteering journey, they will encourage their family members, friends and relatives to join them. Sharing is also helpful if boredom or inertia sets in as fellow volunteers can give advice about different ways of contributing or even make a change to another cause.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Madam, over the past two years, we have weathered the challenges brought on by COVID-19, hand-in-hand, Government and people. As a result, we are in a much stronger position today even as we ride out the current Omicron wave and look forward to a better future. I was reminded of it recently during the Tampines East Edusave Ceremony when this lady said “Hi Miss Cheng, we finally meet”. It turns out that she is the chairlady of her company’s CSR and she had mobilised the team to help out in our mask-making during circuit breaker. We had only corresponded via emails and phone. I remembered then, Standard Chartered Bank also listed my email on their CSR portal and I would get dozens of emails daily asking “How can I help?” The logistics company, taxi driver, fabric supplier who helped, all declined payment. It was their way of contributing to fight the pandemic. Many would have also heard of neighbours helping one another with grocery purchase, mask and sanitiser collection, especially for their elderly neighbours. Our cohesiveness as a nation has strengthened over the pandemic years. Chairman, this cohesiveness among our people and the trust in the Government that we have in Singapore is precious. In many other parts of the world, we have seen how the pandemic had aggravated existing faultlines and even created tensions between the government and people, with anti-vaccination and anti-mask protests. These tensions made it more challenging to deal with the pandemic. Can the Ministry share how we can continue to build upon this spirit of care and strengthen community cohesiveness in Singapore? How can we make volunteerism and care a part of our lives and match like-minded people to the causes that they are interested in? Madam, religious and racial harmony is an important part of our social fabric. We are all aware of how racial riots rocked Singapore in the 1960s. Although many years have by gone, that period holds important lessons for us. From time to time, racist incidents happen and we are reminded that building a multiracial and multi-religious society is, indeed, a work in progress. Take, for example, last year, there was a viral video showing a confrontation between a man and an inter-racial couple. We may not have the full facts of what happened but many of us were rightly disturbed and worried after watching it. We must never waver in our commitment to promote harmony among our people. Therefore, the role of our IRCCs is even more important. When I was a young volunteer, I remember IRCCs organising excursions to Hindu temples, churches and we had buka puasa over nasi dulang in mosques and got to know each other's religion better. Unfortunately, IRCCs stopped having these programmes years ago. What are MCCY's plans to ensure the relevance of IRCC and its role in strengthening our social cohesion?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, since 2009, the annual Pink Dot SG has attracted tens of thousands of Singaporeans to attend in support of the LGBTQ+ community. However, many Singaporeans have also expressed concerns about Pink Dot SG and some have organised counter-events such as Wear White. A 2019 IPS study found that there have been \"steep drops\" in opposition towards LGBTQ+ issues. Unfortunately, divisions along this fault line may nonetheless deepen, given the role other social divides, such as religion and age, play in shaping attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues. If these divisions were left unchecked, it increases the potential for acts of violence and discrimination to be committed against vulnerable groups, including hate speech and online harassment. The Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles or IRCCs have served an important role in strengthening social cohesion through dialogues, workshops and other programmes, amongst various religious and racial groups. In light of the friction concerning LGBTQ+ issues, one way to foster social harmony would be to include vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and migrant workers and other groups, to be a mainstay in initiatives similar to IRCCs. The purpose of such initiatives is not to convert anyone to any particular viewpoint on these issues, but to mitigate polarisation by strengthening social cohesion and fostering understanding and respect across differences. Given the contributions of IRCCs in promoting social harmony, could the Ministry convene similar community engagement initiatives that aim to bridge gaps between religious groups, the LGBTQ+ community and other stakeholders, with the aim of fostering mutual understanding?</td>\n",

       "0  Chairman, the disruption to our economy from the pandemic has had different impact on various segments of our country. COVID-19 has inflicted disproportionate hardship upon those who are less well-off and pushed those at the margins into further difficulties. To make matters worse, rampant misinformation on the internet and social media platforms is adding to the turbulence. Our world is under many stresses and these have the potential to deepen societal divisions, especially those along religious and racial fault lines. There is much work to be done to narrow the gaps. We need to foster a cohesive and caring society in order to recover and forge ahead as one nation. Would MCCY share its strategies on how it will work with Singaporeans to close ranks and become a more united and resilient people? How will the Government ensure that in our fight against the pandemic and consequent chaos, no one is left behind? One of my greatest concerns is the state of racial and religious harmony in Singapore. It is threatened by radicalisation of troubled individuals and groups. The most recent case was that of a 16-year-old student of Protestant faith who plotted to attack two mosques and kill Muslim worshippers here. A few churches in my constituency reached out to the Masjid Jamek Queenstown, also in my division, for a sharing and meal together as an expression of solidarity, to deepen the ties between both faiths and condemned the incident. Strengthening religious harmony is an on-going work in progress. We are one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world. Mutual respect and tolerance are qualities that we must all conscientiously nurture and practice, and teach our young. I commend MCCY for its work to build up religious tolerance among our people and look forward to hearing its new initiatives. I propose MCCY facilitating regular sharing sessions among our different faiths which is key to building trust and understanding. Similarly, we need to put in effort to encourage Singaporeans to do their part to build racial harmony. The more we interact with members of different racial communities, the better we can understand one another and learn that in fact, we have so much more in common than differences. What is exciting for me is that there is much wisdom we can gather from those who are different from us. Would MCCY share the projects and initiatives it has in store to further enhance our racial harmony? One of the silver linings from the COVID-19 pandemic is how it ignited the spirit of “gotong royong” in our society. There are various interpretations and translations for this phrase, including “active citizenry”, “cooperation in a community” and “mutual aid”. My favorite is “carrying burdens together” because gotong means \"carrying a burden using one's shoulder\" and royong means \"together\" or \"communally\". Carrying burdens together implies a willingness to help another lighten his load. It means stepping forward to volunteer and lend a helping hand. During this crisis, many individuals, businesses and community groups have indeed stepped up. They voluntarily contributed time, energy and money to organise their own ground-up initiatives to assist those in need. This outpouring of selflessness brought strangers and the community together in a common cause. I am heartened and inspired by the efforts of our people to work together for the benefit of our community. I earnestly hope that we will be able to continue the momentum and sustain this spirit of mutual care, trust and understanding. Even as we are helping the needy, we are simultaneously building bonds across religious, racial and cultural boundaries, and learning more about ourselves and our Singapore identity. A student volunteer shared how he would never look at a packet of food the same way again after helping to distribute packets of meals to some needy families. Coming from a very comfortable background, it was hard for him to visualise food insecurity in our bustling city. His experience as a volunteer had been an eye opener and strengthened his resolve to be more involved in the community. How is MCCY encouraging more individuals from all walks of life, including youths, as well as corporates, to step forward, volunteer and contribute to make a positive impact? I would like to suggest that the Ministry facilitate regular meetups for volunteers of cause-based programmes to share their experiences, challenges, pains, high points, hopes and more. Each one of us has a different takeaway from our volunteering experiences. Such sharing and interactive sessions will be helpful for bonding and motivating one another to stay involved and keep going. Otherwise, some of them may feel alone along the volunteering journey and drop off. On the other hand, if they enjoy the volunteering journey, they will encourage their family members, friends and relatives to join them. Sharing is also helpful if boredom or inertia sets in as fellow volunteers can give advice about different ways of contributing or even make a change to another cause.\n",

As a result, we are in a much stronger position today even as we ride out the current Omicron wave and look forward to a better future. I was reminded of it recently during the Tampines East Edusave Ceremony when this lady said “Hi Miss Cheng, we finally meet”. It turns out that she is the chairlady of her company’s CSR and she had mobilised the team to help out in our mask-making during circuit breaker. We had only corresponded via emails and phone. I remembered then, Standard Chartered Bank also listed my email on their CSR portal and I would get dozens of emails daily asking “How can I help?” The logistics company, taxi driver, fabric supplier who helped, all declined payment. It was their way of contributing to fight the pandemic. Many would have also heard of neighbours helping one another with grocery purchase, mask and sanitiser collection, especially for their elderly neighbours. Our cohesiveness as a nation has strengthened over the pandemic years. Chairman, this cohesiveness among our people and the trust in the Government that we have in Singapore is precious. In many other parts of the world, we have seen how the pandemic had aggravated existing faultlines and even created tensions between the government and people, with anti-vaccination and anti-mask protests. These tensions made it more challenging to deal with the pandemic. Can the Ministry share how we can continue to build upon this spirit of care and strengthen community cohesiveness in Singapore? How can we make volunteerism and care a part of our lives and match like-minded people to the causes that they are interested in? Madam, religious and racial harmony is an important part of our social fabric. We are all aware of how racial riots rocked Singapore in the 1960s. Although many years have by gone, that period holds important lessons for us. From time to time, racist incidents happen and we are reminded that building a multiracial and multi-religious society is, indeed, a work in progress. Take, for example, last year, there was a viral video showing a confrontation between a man and an inter-racial couple. We may not have the full facts of what happened but many of us were rightly disturbed and worried after watching it. We must never waver in our commitment to promote harmony among our people. Therefore, the role of our IRCCs is even more important. When I was a young volunteer, I remember IRCCs organising excursions to Hindu temples, churches and we had buka puasa over nasi dulang in mosques and got to know each other's religion better. Unfortunately, IRCCs stopped having these programmes years ago. What are MCCY's plans to ensure the relevance of IRCC and its role in strengthening our social cohesion?\n",

However, many Singaporeans have also expressed concerns about Pink Dot SG and some have organised counter-events such as Wear White. A 2019 IPS study found that there have been \"steep drops\" in opposition towards LGBTQ+ issues. Unfortunately, divisions along this fault line may nonetheless deepen, given the role other social divides, such as religion and age, play in shaping attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues. If these divisions were left unchecked, it increases the potential for acts of violence and discrimination to be committed against vulnerable groups, including hate speech and online harassment. The Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles or IRCCs have served an important role in strengthening social cohesion through dialogues, workshops and other programmes, amongst various religious and racial groups. In light of the friction concerning LGBTQ+ issues, one way to foster social harmony would be to include vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and migrant workers and other groups, to be a mainstay in initiatives similar to IRCCs. The purpose of such initiatives is not to convert anyone to any particular viewpoint on these issues, but to mitigate polarisation by strengthening social cohesion and fostering understanding and respect across differences. Given the contributions of IRCCs in promoting social harmony, could the Ministry convene similar community engagement initiatives that aim to bridge gaps between religious groups, the LGBTQ+ community and other stakeholders, with the aim of fostering mutual understanding?"

       "      <td>Yes, Madam. Last year, at the COS of MOT, I mentioned, \"Train services have been disrupted quite frequently due to different factors. Such incidents have impacted on the reliability of the public transport and, at the same time, confidence of the commuters in general.\" I am repeating the same view in view of the latest spate of disruptions on SMRT's rail network. SMRT has apologised and pledged to analyse each incident thoroughly. LTA called the spate of disruptions \"unacceptable\". Local MP Liang Eng Hwa expressed his disappointment and called for LTA and SMRT to get their act together to really bring up the reliability of the system and bring back the public's confidence. And to the 40,000 commuters who were affected by these disruptions, they were very frustrated by the lack of reliability of the system. On top of this, there are also high profile vandalism cases at Bishan MRT depot that put the trains' safety and security standards in the spotlight. Apart from public apology and promise to increase manpower from the operator, and public reprimand from the regulator, what else we need to do to restore commuters' confidence in our train service? May I ask the Minister to give the House an update on the preventive and pre-emptive actions announced last year? Has the Government ensured that the operators provide the necessary manpower capabilities and financial resources to fully comply with the \"Predict and Prevent\" whole-life maintenance approach to the train service assets? To adequately address those questions in the minds of the commuters, could the Minister share if LTA has a comprehensive plan or strategy as the regulator to ensure that its appointed operators and their employees would deliver the expected level of reliability and security in our train services? On train reliability and security, the questions in the minds of the commuters are: (1) How can these outsiders enter the protected area of the train depot so easily? (2) How can these people remain undetected while they went on vandalising the trains? (3) How to ensure that every train leaving the station and depot is secured and safe? (4) How can we cut short the response time when there is a disruption? (5) How can we minimise human errors leading to train service disruption? (6) How can we make sure that our equipment are fit to serve, in tip-top condition, every day before the trains leave the depot to serve the public commuters? (7) Why am I paying higher fare to contribute to the profits of the operators and not to the higher maintenance and security standards of the train services? My next cut – Sustainable improvement on bus services. Bus average daily ridership has hit 3.8 million. We have seen improvements in the public bus services, especially in bus waiting time and frequency. How can we sustain these improvements so that bus commuters could continue to experience better and affordable public bus services? There are two frameworks. One, financing framework. With the bus contracting model, the Government takes the unprecedented step to build and own the operating assets of the public bus service, in particular, the bus monitoring and deployment system and the purchase of buses. The contracted operators are paid by the Government to operate these assets while the Government collect the fare revenue. Through open tender, we now see real market competition in terms of management solutions and fees charged by the competing companies to operate the bundles of public bus routes. As the public transport infrastructure and operating assets are long-term capital investments, could the Minister share with us on what would be the long-term financing framework for public bus service? How the public bus fare would be set under the bus contracting model? Two, operating framework. We used to have multi-model public transport operators who operate both the public bus and train services. Bus and train services are designed to complement each other and not competing against each other. Currently, when the train service is disrupted, public buses belonging to the same PTO –</td>\n",

       "      <td>Madam, the spate of vandals breaking onto trains at Bishan Depot causes much concern. From May 2010, there have been four incidents of such break-ins detected at MRT depots, the latest in November last year. This was despite various security measures being employed by SMRT and re-assurances given in this House since 2010 about the comprehensive security review being undertaken by the Public Transport Security Committee to address security gaps in our entire transport system. Are these measures working? Just last month, on 27 February, train services were stopped briefly in the evening as a result of a man walking on the viaduct between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations. Madam, we have been extremely lucky that the security breaches so far involve graffiti artists rather than terrorists. We were told in Parliament in 2010 that the current security framework was that PTOs where the primary responsibility for day-to-day operational security and are placed to decide which measures are the most feasible. We were also told that the Government sets security standards and also does security audits. It is thus worrying that despite the specific concern about depot security being flagged out in 2010, it seems that certain vulnerabilities of Bishan Depot were only attended to in 2014 after two intrusions there. Why was this not picked up earlier? The Minister has announced that the LTA will introduce new security-related standards within the operating performance standards for PTOs. Failure to comply will attract penalties up to $1 million or 10% of the licensee's annual fare revenue of the affected rail system whichever is higher. The next breach may not be by a graffiti artist but by a terrorist and a fine of $1 million then will be too little and too late compared to the grave consequences of a terrorist attack. Is it time for the Government to be more proactive in assisting the PTOs to enhance security?</td>\n",

Such incidents have impacted on the reliability of the public transport and, at the same time, confidence of the commuters in general.\" I am repeating the same view in view of the latest spate of disruptions on SMRT's rail network. SMRT has apologised and pledged to analyse each incident thoroughly. LTA called the spate of disruptions \"unacceptable\". Local MP Liang Eng Hwa expressed his disappointment and called for LTA and SMRT to get their act together to really bring up the reliability of the system and bring back the public's confidence. And to the 40,000 commuters who were affected by these disruptions, they were very frustrated by the lack of reliability of the system. On top of this, there are also high profile vandalism cases at Bishan MRT depot that put the trains' safety and security standards in the spotlight. Apart from public apology and promise to increase manpower from the operator, and public reprimand from the regulator, what else we need to do to restore commuters' confidence in our train service? May I ask the Minister to give the House an update on the preventive and pre-emptive actions announced last year? Has the Government ensured that the operators provide the necessary manpower capabilities and financial resources to fully comply with the \"Predict and Prevent\" whole-life maintenance approach to the train service assets? To adequately address those questions in the minds of the commuters, could the Minister share if LTA has a comprehensive plan or strategy as the regulator to ensure that its appointed operators and their employees would deliver the expected level of reliability and security in our train services? On train reliability and security, the questions in the minds of the commuters are: (1) How can these outsiders enter the protected area of the train depot so easily? (2) How can these people remain undetected while they went on vandalising the trains? (3) How to ensure that every train leaving the station and depot is secured and safe? (4) How can we cut short the response time when there is a disruption? (5) How can we minimise human errors leading to train service disruption? (6) How can we make sure that our equipment are fit to serve, in tip-top condition, every day before the trains leave the depot to serve the public commuters? (7) Why am I paying higher fare to contribute to the profits of the operators and not to the higher maintenance and security standards of the train services? My next cut – Sustainable improvement on bus services. Bus average daily ridership has hit 3.8 million. We have seen improvements in the public bus services, especially in bus waiting time and frequency. How can we sustain these improvements so that bus commuters could continue to experience better and affordable public bus services? There are two frameworks. One, financing framework. With the bus contracting model, the Government takes the unprecedented step to build and own the operating assets of the public bus service, in particular, the bus monitoring and deployment system and the purchase of buses. The contracted operators are paid by the Government to operate these assets while the Government collect the fare revenue. Through open tender, we now see real market competition in terms of management solutions and fees charged by the competing companies to operate the bundles of public bus routes. As the public transport infrastructure and operating assets are long-term capital investments, could the Minister share with us on what would be the long-term financing framework for public bus service? How the public bus fare would be set under the bus contracting model? Two, operating framework. We used to have multi-model public transport operators who operate both the public bus and train services. Bus and train services are designed to complement each other and not competing against each other. Currently, when the train service is disrupted, public buses belonging to the same PTO –\n",

From May 2010, there have been four incidents of such break-ins detected at MRT depots, the latest in November last year. This was despite various security measures being employed by SMRT and re-assurances given in this House since 2010 about the comprehensive security review being undertaken by the Public Transport Security Committee to address security gaps in our entire transport system. Are these measures working? Just last month, on 27 February, train services were stopped briefly in the evening as a result of a man walking on the viaduct between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations. Madam, we have been extremely lucky that the security breaches so far involve graffiti artists rather than terrorists. We were told in Parliament in 2010 that the current security framework was that PTOs where the primary responsibility for day-to-day operational security and are placed to decide which measures are the most feasible. We were also told that the Government sets security standards and also does security audits. It is thus worrying that despite the specific concern about depot security being flagged out in 2010, it seems that certain vulnerabilities of Bishan Depot were only attended to in 2014 after two intrusions there. Why was this not picked up earlier? The Minister has announced that the LTA will introduce new security-related standards within the operating performance standards for PTOs. Failure to comply will attract penalties up to $1 million or 10% of the licensee's annual fare revenue of the affected rail system whichever is higher. The next breach may not be by a graffiti artist but by a terrorist and a fine of $1 million then will be too little and too late compared to the grave consequences of a terrorist attack. Is it time for the Government to be more proactive in assisting the PTOs to enhance security?"

       "      <td>Mdm Chair, last year, I spoke on this and brought up the dip in volunteering when youths leave school and enter the workforce. The Minister pointed out then that a key barrier to volunteering occurs when individuals enter the workforce. Although there are more Singaporeans engaged in volunteer work today as compared to the past, we have yet to be able to engage companies in a sustainable way. Corporates have the financial and professional capabilities to do more in Singapore, and I believe employees have the skills and the heart to contribute more in terms of volunteering. How can we urge more companies, including their top leadership, to drive more giving efforts? Early this year, the SG Care and Share Day was launched as the inaugural volunteering event for SG50. It is a good initiative to have an annual event that engages the public and promotes the awareness of volunteering. In October last year, there was also a \"Redefining Community Giving\" conference that looked at other ways of giving to society and also skills-based volunteering. Skills-based volunteering is win-win for both companies and society - skills-based volunteers have been shown to have higher employee morale than non-volunteers, and social organisations benefit from the volunteers' skills and knowledge for capacity-building. Minister Wong had spoken of his Ministry's plans to do more to engage companies, and one way was by working with partners like NVPC and like-minded companies to promote a corporate giving culture. May I ask about the progress of efforts in this area? Has there been a greater involvement of companies so far? Youth Volunteerism and Social Enterprise</td>\n",

       "      <td>Firstly, I would like to thank the men in the House for the well wishes. I always say we are so blessed to be living in Singapore where ladies are well respected and treated fairly. I cannot ask for more. Mr Chairman, in a 2018 June article from the Straits Times, Minister Grace Fu said that, \"Singapore hopes to double its volunteerism rate from one in three currently to 70 per cent in five years' time\". This is a laudable goal to aim for, and I believe it can come to fruition through a combination of various factors. As citizens of Singapore, we all take responsibility for our lives and actions. The Government does not believe in giving handouts and it is the civic duty of citizens to help the less fortunate in our country. Currently, the rate of volunteerism in Singapore has grown from 9% in 2000 to 35% in 2016, with the total volunteer hours doubling from 66 million hours in 2014 to 121 million hours in 2016. As it is, the benefits of volunteerism are manifold. It is a source of significant contribution to the global economy. According to statistics from the Johns Hopkins Centre for Civil Society Studies in 2011, approximately 140 million people in the 37 countries engage in volunteer work in a typical year. It is estimated that volunteers contribute around $400 billion to the global economy annually. Apart from economic contribution, volunteerism also enhances social connections between different sectors, and builds bridges across Governments, enterprises and employees. It encourages citizens to be more active in civic engagement and mindful of their role in society. Positive effects on volunteers as individuals includes increases in self-esteem, enhanced emotional skills and capacities, expansion in career paths and an overall healthier physique and mentality. However, there are various influencing factors at play in Singapore which reduce the take up rate of volunteering. Chiefly among these is the reason that citizens have no time to volunteer. They fail to understand that giving to others does not mean having less time for oneself. As a result, fewer are giving up their time and effort to volunteer for a good cause, even though donations are substantial. As Singapore faces an ageing population crisis, it is even more crucial that youths are being engaged to volunteer with the elderly population. With the SG Cares platform, it is possible to match an individual's community work with volunteering opportunities of their choice. It is heartening to see a sixteen-fold increase in youths' participation from 2009 to 2019, with youths making up almost 80% of the volunteers registered on the website. So, this begs the question: how can we further encourage the increase in number and depth of volunteerism in our nation? I would like to propose that we attract business and public sector leaders who are retired or close to retirement to volunteer. This draws from a large pool of ageing population with longer life expectancy, who are highly educated, active and financially secure. They are also proven managers of people, finances and complex programmes, who understand the benefits of meaningful work and are motivated to contribute to society. The knowledge, experience and energy that these leaders bring represent a significant potential resource for the non-profit and charitable sector. The result is a win-win situation which benefits both the community and retired leaders themselves, as volunteers generally enjoy improved health and wellness in the form of personal accomplishment and lower levels of depression. To attract these leaders, I would like to propose a two-pronged approach. Firstly, it is necessary to build a pre-retirement awareness of volunteering. An effective way is to locate and extend a personal invitation to leaders who are retired or will be retired in five years' time. The second approach would be to design suitable volunteer opportunities. We should create awareness of the complete range of volunteer opportunities offered, and then ensure that volunteer opportunities have specific targets and deliverables. Volunteers would be more attracted to activities with clear job descriptions, well defined expectations and timelines. Short-term volunteer opportunities can also be offered to those with competing interests and limited available time. Nevertheless, the most important aspect of attracting any form of volunteers will inevitably start with us. We as leaders of the nation are duty-bound to lead by example and be a visible beacon on the frontlines. Only after being volunteers ourselves can we be exemplars and speak with passion about the great joy volunteerism can bring, in order to galvanise fellow citizens to be authentic volunteers. Personally, I have been a pharmacist volunteer at a local Hospice for the past 20 years. Our volunteer pharmacists take turns every Saturday to visit the institution to sort out medication waste and monitor inventory of medications. On the days when it is my turn, I will bring along one of my four children to help out. I task them to perform the \"first cut\" expiry date stock check while I sort out bags of medication waste for appropriate disposal and check on stock levels to trigger ordering. The aim is to attempt to engage them from young to appreciate the spirit of volunteering, though I will still re-check after them. At the end of our duty, as we walk along the corridor on our way out, I will ask my child to \"peek\" into a patient's room. I explain to them how the two hours spent earlier has helped to ensure that these terminally ill patients don't run out of essential medications, and are not taking expired drugs which may affect their pain control, vomiting or infection. Ensuring appropriate disposal of these medications also has significant impact on protecting our environment and safety of our residents. Seeing the patients comfortable in bed during their last days can be especially emotional and underscores the heartfelt importance of the work that we are doing. And this is what has kept me going for the past 20 years as a volunteer. Volunteerism should be a life-time commitment, not simply a once-off Community Involvement project. It is a calling and must come from the heart. As a community leader and a mother who wants my young children to espouse the values of volunteerism, it also starts with us as leaders to shape the roads for successive generations to follow. The greatest leader is also the most willing servant. Mr Chairman, I would like to leave you with a quote from MK Gandhi: \"The best way to find yourself, is to lose yourself in the service of others.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Today, the global environment is more fractious and societies are increasingly polarised. Disruptive technologies are changing our economies, our jobs, our way of life and challenging our norms. Singapore is a global city state that is multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and in some way multinational is at the epicentre of these forces. If we are not careful, these global forces can exert tensions that will threaten, disrupt and test the strength of the fabric of our society. While MCCY has done well in fostering a strong sense of national unity and pride through sectors of arts, youth, community and sports, new challenges such as the COVID-19, regional political turmoil and international trade tensions are always emerging and we must be prepared to remain resilient and stay united as one Singapore. MCCY must continue to strengthen the social fabric and the solidarity in the face of these forces. Are the current MCCY's strategies still relevant in the building an inclusive home where everyone feels that we are equal members of the same community, and are given equal opportunities to thrive and to pursue one's passion and interest? Given the increasing diversity and fractious state of our society, can we continue to progress together as a people? What unites us as one people, one nation? Is it the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave when Singapore Lions beat Pahang during the 1994 Malaysian cup? Or the 50.39 secs that Joseph Schooling swam while we all held our breath in front of our TV screens during the 2016 Olympics? Or the nail-biting table tennis finals during the 2008 Olympics when our paddlers brought us a silver medal? We wept as a nation as we mourned together during the passing of our beloved founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2015. People of all walks of life regarding of race, language or religion came together to queue for hours under the weather, rain or shine, day or night, to pay their last respect. We faced fear and death together during the 2003 SARS crisis which infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Today, we are again tested and challenged and tested with COVID-19. We are tackling these challenges together and collectively with resolute and resilience. As we continue to progress, the natural fault lines in our society – socio-economic divide, racial and religious divide, ideology divide, sexual orientation divide, e-literacy divide and many more – will continue to exist and may surface from time to time to threaten our resolve and unity. Will we be able to rise to the occasion like previous challenges and emerge stronger or will we be divided and withered? MCCY needs to intensify the efforts in building a home that provides opportunities for all. It is important while we embrace our diversity and differences as strength of our nation, we need to work hard to create and expand common spaces and experiences that is unique to Singapore. To do this, I have three suggestions. One, use arts, culture and heritage unique to Singapore. Make of arts and cultural programmes more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans. Similar to the $100 Active SG credits for sports facilities, MCCY can consider giving all Singaporeans $100 Active Arts and Culture credit to attend arts and cultural courses or attend local arts &amp; cultural performances. Two, renew and remake of community clubs to remain relevant so that more Singaporeans will visit and use the CCs. Our CCs should be the Community Centre for arts, culture, wellness and health, social interactions and skills upgrading. Three, expand and build up community sports that can unite and bring people together. Top up the Active SG credits on a regular basis to promote community sports and expand the use of Active credits to sports events attendance, including our SG football leagues and national sports events. Chairman, building a home that provide opportunities for all is not just an ideal. It is a reality. It is a basic right for all Singaporeans. I would like to thank MCCY for their hard work and invite all Singaporeans from all walks of life to join MCCY to make this arduous task a reality. Question proposed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, I would like to declare that I am on the Boards of SISTIC and Esplanade. Artists, musicians and their work give meaning to the complex world in which we live. During the lockdown, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli performed at an empty Milan Cathedral and lifted the spirits of millions around the world. Museums offered free virtual tours to all who needed a culture fix while self-isolating. And I joined Singaporeans all across the island to belt out in solidarity from our balconies, Dick Lee’s “Home Truly”. Indeed, like Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech, “Human beings need the arts and culture to nourish our souls”. The arts and culture industry is amongst the hardest hit by COVID-19. Creative people are, however, resilient people, and the “show must go on\". Many have pivoted to teaching, and of course, going digital is inevitable. SISTIC, for example, had to pivot quickly so as to support our Arts groups and venues to go online. Esplanade and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) were amongst the first to pilot with ticketed livestream performances here, and viewers, including global audiences, were delighted to consume Singapore arts content during the circuit breaker. To go digital, artists need a digital stage but tech resources are scarce and funding is needed, especially since many in the creative sector are gig workers, self-employed professionals (SEPs) and SMEs. A young Singaporean woman composer/musician, NyaLi shared with me her gratitude for the “Geylang Serai Arts Platform” which helped her to go digital. I was encouraged to hear NyaLi tell me that she signed up for a course on Digital Marketing and is also using her talents to help the disadvantaged. COVID-19 is the burning platform that drives businesses and professionals across all sectors to digitalise, to reskill and to transform; and the Arts is no exception. Does MCCY plan to scale platforms like Geylang Serai? Will MCCY support with more shared space for ideation and experimentation? Is it in MCCY’s plans to bring the creative and tech talents together to co-create new innovative models for the Arts? Performances have started to come back but audience max at 250 people and in \"bubble wrap seating\". It does not look like large scale events and lounge performances will return in the near future. Does the $45 million Resilience Package, which is much appreciated, support the gig workers and SEPs in our creative industries? And can the social and wellness industries tap on our creative talents? Sir, the creative value-chain – from artists to production houses, from promoters to event organisers, from venues to ticketing agents, from designers to art and music teachers – all contribute to Singapore's creative capital, that is, Singapore’s “soft power”. I hope that Singaporeans, corporates, the Government and the creative community themselves can come together to strengthen and grow our Singapore creative capital. Now that we even have a University of the Arts, what would have to be true for our creative capital to turn to gold for Singapore, like what K-pop and K-drama did for Korea? And on that note, let me close with the lyrics from one of NyaLi’s COVID-19 singles: “The world is big and we are small; geography can be so cruel; but I’d like to think that love stands up; tall and proud on her own.” Thank you and I wish everyone Happy International Women’s Day!</td>\n",

       "      <td>At the outset, I would like to declare that I am Chairman of the SNOC's Athletes' Commission; Member of the Olympic Council of Asian's Athlete Committee; Honorary Secretary of Olympians Singapore and Director of Secretariat at the Global Esports Federation My first cut relates to the development of a skills framework for the sports and fitness industry. It is undeniable that for an industry to grow and thrive, it must be set up in an environment that is conducive for such growth. The necessary conditions must be there to make people to want to join the industry and develop it. My question today is, are these conditions present for the sports and fitness industry and can more be done to facilitate this growth? To my mind, the industry could do well to develop a framework that is competency and skills oriented. Countries like the UK and Australia already have frameworks in place that require employers to hire coaches and fitness trainers who complete specified vocational courses. Further, to get a better sense of the industry's specific needs, the focus should be on engaging the people who do the work daily. The demands of the industry are everchanging and it would be difficult for the Government machinery to keep pace with the dynamic demands. Say, nutrition. There are many fads out there – the keto diet, Atkins diet, the list goes on. Would HPB be able to keep coming up with the requisite courses to train people in these areas? The short answer is that it would be difficult and costly. Sports and fitness is a multi-faceted industry and a cookie-cutter approach would be difficult to apply. So, considering the industry's needs and the existing infrastructure already in place, I would suggest a skills framework to be developed by the sports industry, for the sports industry, with the full support of the Singapore Government. This would lead to a meaningful growth in a more cost-effective and targeted way. Chairman, my second cut relates to the JSS for the sports and fitness sector. In my Budget debate speech, I highlighted that the pandemic has severely hit the sports, fitness and wellness industry. Although Singapore is easing into phase 3, sports and fitness academies and establishments are not able to fully open due to social distancing measures. Pool space is reduced, school programmes and facilities are limited, and gyms cannot operate to efficient capacities. Also, establishments located in retail facilities still have the added pressure of rental. Some gym operators are reporting as low as 50% revenues compared to pre-COVID 19 levels. Because of this, I would like MCCY to consider upgrading the sports and fitness industry from tier 3 to Tier 2 for JSS support. I would also like to thank Minister at MCCY for recognising the sector and for extending more support to the industry through the Sports Innovation Grant and Operating Grant extension to December 2021. This will complement the JSS. My third cut is on the development of the e-sports industry in Singapore. Chairman, it is my pleasure to speak on the emergence and progress of e-sports in Singapore today. I would like to not only talk about e-sports through the lens of the future but about the possibilities for Singapore today, as the future has indeed arrived on our shores. Today, large-scale e-sports tournaments draw more viewers than \"traditional sports\". For instance, the League of Legends World Championships held in Shanghai in late 2020, drew more than 46 million viewers. The world has also come to recognise e-sports as part of the sports eco-system. Recently, the Olympic Council of Asia confirmed that the Asian Games would offer a programme where e-sports has its place as a full medal event in 2022. E-sports is one of the sectors which has grown rapidly and accelerated during the pandemic. With viewership and gaming participation currently at all-time highs, and in a time where content is king, you can expect e-sports to be here to stay. The e-sports industry currently sees double-digit growth and such growth has found its way into the Singapore landscape. With Singapore's strong local infrastructure, like fast and stable Internet, top global teams have found Singapore very conducive for their professional team training. There are more than 20 full-time professional players here, with the top 10 having made more than $3 million in prize winnings alone. This figure does not include salaries and sponsorships. There are also others employed as full-time coaches and managers of local teams as well as professional teams in major markets like the US and China. Looking ahead, top e-sports events in Singapore are expected to spend at least $30 million in 2021. This will boost many local start-ups and businesses in media, events and supporting services. Promising local start-ups like yup.gg and EVOS have between them raised more than $31 million in investments and we can expect many more to follow in their footsteps. They look on track to follow successful local-born companies like Sea and Razer, who grew a good part of their business thanks to e-sports and gaming, creating thousands of jobs in the process. Multinational companies in the e-sports and gaming industry like Tencent, Ubisoft and Moonton have also set up regional offices here in Singapore. They are expected to introduce hundreds of jobs in the coming year. On a sports administrative front, we welcomed the world to the launch of the Global Esports Federation (GEF) on 16 December 2019 to convene the world's e-sports eco-system right here in Singapore. That very same day, we welcomed the world's largest gaming company and technology giant, Tencent, as the founding global partner of the GEF. Having Tencent with us has helped propel plans into reality. The vision of Tencent's leadership saw them join the GEF as its very first partner and, in less than a year later, to establish its regional hub right here in Singapore. The GEF launch, watched by over 940 million people across the globe, crystalised in our minds the power, potential and reach of e-sports around the world. For us at home in Singapore, we saw opportunities—it is not gaming and e-sports alone but the large, growing eco-system around it. The possibilities are boundless across education, events, health and wellness initiatives, technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation. With these developments, I believe Singapore can and should do more to take on a leading role in shaping the industry. Mr Chairman, my remarks today come with a sense of optimism and opportunity, hope, and genuine excitement for the future. I believe the future of e-sports is incredibly bright if we gather our knowledge, listen to each other and help shape the future together. E-sports is alive, it is real and it is evolving at an ever-increasing pace. Indeed, e-sports can offer a space for everyone and it makes good business and economic sense. The possibilities are boundless if we seize the opportunities we have been given and which we helped create. We intend to host the annual Global Esports Games in December 2021 and every year after that. A rich portfolio of events will fill the calendar with a global platform for competition and entertainment. This event offers another excellent opportunity for Singapore to welcome the world and shape how the world consumes live events. My sincere hope is that Singapore's e-sports community will grow and prosper and better e-sports globally to benefit athletes, players, teams and other stakeholders in our community. Just as the Olympic Movement values elevate sports, we hope to highlight and bring out the best in e-sports. Mr Chairman, my last cut relates to creating our sporting heritage. In my Budget debate speech, I took the opportunity to recognise our past athletes who had done Singapore proud in times when resources were scarce and inspired generations after them to take on the mantle and fly Singapore's flag high on the world stage. Olympians and national athletes in the earlier decades had to resort to their own resources to help sustain and balance earning a living and competing in sports. Incentive programmes such as the Major Games Award Programme were established in the 1990s, which do not confer retrospective recognition. More can be done to recognise and help these athletes who contributed to Singapore's sporting glory and paved the way for future generations to succeed. Currently, there is no system to help keep retired athletes engaged in the national programmes, save for Olympians Singapore. I honestly believe that athletes want to continue to give back to their fraternity and inspire Singaporeans. Indeed, when an athlete retires, there is no engagement beyond that. Many athletes have gone on to establish themselves in the corporate and business world. They would likely hire ex-national athletes and sponsor programmes – they were from the system, after all. It is a waste that this is not done. My thoughts are that heritage is closely linked with culture. Just as we reminisce on the glory of the Kallang Roar, we must remain cognisant that youth today may not know what that means. We have a sports heritage in that the current generations can stand on our past sporting giants' shoulders. I hope MCCY can do more to recognise and engage past athletes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mdm Chairman, the cultural and creative sectors of our economy are crucial in their own right in terms of their economic footprint and the employment opportunities that they offer across the board. At the same time, we cannot underestimate the innovation that the arts and culture sectors spur across the economy. With wellness and inclusion as key focuses, the arts and culture also offer channels for positive social impact. They encourage education about Singapore’s identity and as well as revitalise our city life. Yet, the arts and culture sector has been hard-hit by the pandemic and has been severely disrupted by it. In addition to short-term support for artists and firms, which comes from both the public and private sector, policies can also leverage the economic and social impacts of culture in their broader recovery packages and efforts to transform our economy. With COVID-19, digital presentations have provided a lifeline, allowing audiences a new experience in the consumption of the arts. The digital space has provided both opportunities and challenges for local arts groups as they overcome the safe distancing measures and cross into a digital space that is not limited by physical boundaries. Yet, there is also a need to reimagine the business models used in the arts and culture sector so that they are sustainable. Offering free programmes worked for the short-run but the arts also need to be monetised. Effort needs to be placed on the protection of intellectual property in the digital space. Manpower planning and growth are also crucial as the arts groups rethink on how to increase capabilities to augment the production quality of digital works. Additionally, talent needs to be boosted through the exploration of new ways of blending digital formats with real-life arts and culture offerings. Training programmes for freelancers and collaborations with the private sector players are some of the ways to further talent growth to ensure sustained development of the arts and culture sectors. What are MCCY’s strategies to revitalise the arts and culture sectors and ensure that our organisations and freelancers are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal? Can MCCY provide an update on the impact of ACRP and the support provided to organisations and freelancers? Can MCCY elaborate on its plans to further strengthen the socio-economic nexus of our arts and culture sector, including manpower development and plans for digitalisation, to ensure that our artists are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal? The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on sports participation on many levels, including the cancelling or scaling down of mass participation events. Safe distancing measures as well as concerns about the danger of large clusters forming have had an impact on sports participation. At the same time, there are new developments in sports aimed at coping with the limitations of safe distancing measures. Capacity constraints in sporting venues and the limitations on the way team sport can be engaged has resulted in innovations. An example of innovative approaches to physical space are emerging, such as the use of small box gyms that offer physical fitness enthusiasts a new and different lease of life. Yet, sports and the communal nature of many sporting activities has a huge role to play in the psycho-social aspects of life. These benefits include cooperation, coping with confidence and shyness issues, dealing with stress and coping with aggression and violence. Sports can help curb social isolation and serve as a catharsis or outlet for those dealing with emotional issues. Sports also play a critical and important role in bringing Singaporeans together. Sports, whether it is through participation or spectatorship, foster a sense of pride and builds a confident nation, through interaction with athletes or sports fan bases. To paraphrase Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, \"The important thing in life is not the triumph, but the fight; the essential thing is not to have won, but to have fought well.” So, in this regard, sports can be used to develop an individuals’ resilience as well. Can MCCY share its strategies to bring sports participation back into the new normal? Can MCCY share its strategies to restore and reinvigorate national sports participation, increase access to sports facilities, and reintroduce mass sport events in a safe manner? Sports has the ability to reinforce the idea of the importance of equality. For the fourth Paralympics in a row, Singapore’s para-athletes have come back with a haul of medals in spite of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Athletes, such as Yip Pin Xiu and Paraglider Jessica Goh, have gunned for gold, winning the hearts of Singaporeans. Other para-athletes, such as archer Nur Syahidah Alim, cyclists Steve Tee and competition partner Ang Kee Meng, have shown how sports can build an inclusive society through opportunities for talent to shine. In October last year, it was reported that Yip Pin Xiu will receive $800,000 for the two gold medals she won at the Tokyo Paralympic Games in August 2021. It is, indeed, commendable that sponsors, such as DBS and the Tote Board, have stepped in with the cash awards to help the athletes and reward them for their sacrifice. The work of the Singapore National Paralympic Council (SNPC), which focuses on enabling our elite para-athletes to participate in major games, such as the ASEAN Para Games, Asian Para Games, Asian Youth Para Games, Commonwealth Games and Paralympic Games, has also been crucial as the SNPC has undertaken collaborations to enable our para-athletes to soar. It is important to leverage on the international success of these para-athletes to encourage more sports participation at all levels. So, what is MCCY doing to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports? In line with MCCY’s commitment at the Parliament motion last year to honour our athletes, what is MCCY doing to support para-athletes and provide more opportunities for our aspiring para-athletes, especially for those who wish to pursue sports at a competitive level to represent Singapore in the international arena? Can MCCY also elaborate on its strategies to provide more inclusiveness through sports in the next phase of the Disability Sports Master Plan? In sports it is not the will to win that matters but the will to prepare to win according to Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, the late American football coach. At some of the major games such as the Southeast Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games, major games preparation is an important ingredient in the athletes’ preparation to enhance performance and recovery. Madam, these games and the results achieved can only be reinforced through advance planning and real-time involvement and investment in scientific methods. Effort also needs to be placed on minimising the distractions and stress faced by athletes during games time, enabling them to focus on their performance. There is also much behind-the scenes work by organisations such as Sports Singapore and the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) that have collaborated to prepare for major games to deliver preparation plans, games preparation workshops, performance analysis. Enhanced sports medicine as well as sports science are being employed to support athletes in their games preparations. There is also the need to invest time and funds in coaching and providing the best in terms of infrastructure, programmes and sports facilities so that our athletes can thrive, stress-free and focused on delivering an optimum performance. Mdm Chairan, given the pressures that they face, athletes’ mental health is just as crucial so that they can deal with the pressure that intense competition brings. All this preparation and investment is only meaningful and only possible if there is psychological support for the athletes and their efforts. Can MCCY provide an update on how Team Singapore athletes are progressing in their preparation for the major games in 2022 and beyond? What efforts are underway to rally Singaporeans to support Team Singapore. Sports has the potential to galvanise and inspire the nation? Can MCCY share its efforts to rally Singaporeans to show their support for Team Singapore, and also to provide platforms for Team Singapore athletes to connect with and inspire Singaporeans?</td>\n",

Our para athletes have been an inspiration to us all. They show us what it means to defy the odds and what is possible when you are not defined or constrained by physical limitations. We can and should draw from their example to encourage more participation in sports in Singapore, especially among persons with disabilities (PWDs). I am happy to hear about the Para Sport Academy but beyond the high performance sporting participation, we should look at how we can facilitate regular participation in sport activities by improving access and creating more opportunities for PWDs to be involved. There are many good reasons for this. For one, sport activities are a good way to keep healthy. We heard yesterday at the MOH COS debate about preventive health and physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Sport activities not only help with physical wellness but also mental well-being as participants interact with others and build relationships through their interactions. Secondly, sports can be so empowering for PWDs. With facilitation and proper guidance, PWDs can acquire useful social skills and build up their confidence as they participate in sport activities that they enjoy. Thirdly, there is so much potential to promote inclusiveness through sports. Sports is a social leveller that does not distinguish between educational levels, socio-economic status, race or religion. It helps bring together people from all walks of life. We can support and cheer for each other and use common facilities together. This would help normalise different abilities and open doors to better appreciation and understanding of differences. I note that there have been efforts on this front. There is a Disability Sports Master Plan in place setting the roadmap for various initiatives. There are inclusive gyms and several disability sports programmes and also efforts by SportsSG. I also understand that various stakeholders like Singapore Disability Sports Council and MOE work with SportsSG to enable talent development in disability sports and strengthen capabilities in the ecosystem. I would like to understand if we have been tracking our progress. Have there been developments on inclusive physical exercise and disability sports programmes? Is knowledge and expertise in tailoring sports activities for PWDs and organising inclusive sports programmes sufficiently widespread? I hope the Ministry can share its plans to leverage on sports to make Singapore a more inclusive society. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about much disruption and challenges to all, including our youth. Our young people had to contend with significant changes in their educational journey and there was a particularly specific impact for those who were in certain courses of study or at the tail end of their formal education. They had to quickly adjust to learning online, with less interaction with teachers and other students. It was especially challenging for those in technical courses where hands-on learning is important. Internship programmes had to be adjusted as firms implemented work-from-home arrangements. Those who had planned to study overseas or go for an exchange programme had their plans disrupted. Prospects for some industries appeared bleak as the economy pivoted and some wondered about their choice of study and career prospects. This caused much anxiety and uncertainty. Some young people I spoke to expressed how the pandemic robbed them of their opportunities and youth. The impact on their mental well-being was indeed significant. According to the NYC Youth Statistics in Brief 2020, the youth labour force participation rates for the year 2019 was 61% for ages 20 to 24; 90.1% for ages 25 to 29; 92.3% for ages 30 to 34. According to the MOM report in June 2021, the youth unemployment rate climbed in 2020. Annual average resident youth unemployment rate hit 10.6%, 1.8% higher than during the 2009 global financial crisis and 1.3% higher than during the 2003 SARS pandemic. While the situation is challenging for those transiting from school to work, I feel that our youth have shown a lot of resilience in overcoming their situation. There may be industries affected but there are many opportunities abound and new growth areas. It is important, therefore, to strategically look at how we can support youth to seize the opportunities and provide them with the relevant insights so that they are motivated and have the necessary information to make decisions for their future. Mentors, especially in growth sectors, can play a meaningful role in this effort. I am a strong believer in mentoring. I support the efforts of Mentoring Alliance Singapore and oversee the youth empowerment and mentoring programmes under M3. I do not think I need to extol the virtues of mentoring to this House. We all know the value of having that someone in your life to give guidance and motivation as you venture into new unknown and challenging areas. I would like though, to emphasise the importance of mentoring in opening world views and nudging young people to explore possibilities. This is especially significant for families of certain economic status, where their children do not benefit from the social capital of those who are more well-to-do or well-connected. Their world view may be circumscribed by what they see their parents do. Even if they get inspired by someone they read or hear about in the news, they do not know how to get there, how to achieve the same things. Given the current evolution of the economy post-pandemic, it is timely, in fact more urgent now, to train people from various growing industries to become mentors. Further, not everyone is as fortunate to meet a mentor who can guide her along. We need to make sure that every young person has access to the support she needs. There are a lot more programmes and opportunities now as compared to the time when I was in school. We could continue to improve on this by creating an ecosystem and culture of mentoring in Singapore. That way, every young person will have access to mentors and when they grow older, may be mentors themselves. Aside from educational development and career prospects, it is important to also look into the emotional development and resilience of youth. There is a lot of awareness now about mental well-being and its impact on the holistic development of an individual. We should garner the insights and build that in as part of the training of mentors or mentoring programmes. I, therefore, hope that MCCY can look at efforts to develop a more strategic and current mentoring framework for our youth. I believe with these efforts, we can continue to encourage our youth to be resilient and hopeful for the future.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chairman, as part of the Government's overall efforts to secure a sustainable future for Singapore, can MCCY elaborate on its plans to ensure a greener and more sustainable sports ecosystem? In my previous green, sustainability-related Parliamentary speeches, I have shared my firm belief that community involvement plays a vital role in our overall nations efforts towards SG Green Plan 2030 through our collective efforts and embracing an eco-friendly lifestyle and greenify the environment. In order to achieve that, the Government needs to set up the right hardware and co-create the green software. Active SG Woodlands Sports Centre situated in our Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC is one such example. A community farm was actually set up right next to its swimming pool and is being cared for by a team of passionate Team Nila Volunteers as well as members of the public living around the vicinity of Marsiling and Woodgrove. The ground-up recycling effort at this community farm is commendable. Most of the fittings there are actually recycled items contributed and creatively put together by residents and ActiveSG staff. They have also exhibited their innovativeness by harvesting rainwater to irrigate the greens. These green farming activities not only keep the members active and fit but also build a strong kampong spirit as they routinely contribute the harvest to the vulnerable groups in our community along with sharing their green tips to other community gardens within the neighbourhood. Are there any other plans for Sport SG to roll out up similar green concepts to other sports centres across Singapore? How else does MCCY intend to involve the sports community, Singaporeans and partners from the private sectors to co-create solutions for sustainability and play a part in these efforts. Minister Edwin Tong has previously shared in his views that our young people are a crucial segment of our society. The youths of today are the leaders of tomorrow. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister. Our youths are the people who must have a say in the kind of society they want to be in it and should play an active role in shaping Singapore's future. Youths today, however, faced many uncertainties, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic and other global issues. Many of them are also in transitions through different life stages. These have placed a significant amount of stress on our young people, especially in areas such as job prospects, finances and mental well-being. Despite these challenges, we have witnessed many of them will have tirelessly volunteered their time and effort in serving the vulnerable groups in our community during this eventful period. I am particularly grateful to the youths in our Woodgrove community. Despite facing their own challenges, they have organised mental wellness talks to motivate others to stay positive, distributed \"Return to School\" care packs to low-income group children, hosted upcycling \"Go Green\" workshops and planned many clean-up estate initiatives to raise empathy for our cleaners. Can MCCY share what is done to support youths' concerns and needs in their key priority areas? How does the whole Government intend to work together to support youths in navigating their various life stages and transitions? What has also been done to provide opportunities and support to our youths of different cultures and backgrounds to continue contributing to the community and mold the future of our Singapore, despite the present challenges that each of them may be facing now?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Madam, I would like to declare my interest as President of the Basketball Association of Singapore. Under Vision 2030, the concept of a \"Super Sports Club\" was surfaced to extend the reach of quality sporting programmes and events to all Singaporeans. Leveraging on the enhanced sports facilities, the Super Sports Club provides an island-wide integrated network of sports programming, events, competitions and places for people to enjoy sports. The Super Sports Club allows for the community to embrace \"fitness for life\" and a sporting culture, which will reap social dividends, in particular, in areas of health, wellness, active ageing and community bonding. For the more serious sportsmen or women, they can now take to competitive sports. Others can have access to players and places to practise and play their sports beyond school or competitive days. Our seniors can also benefit tremendously by being physically and socially active through sports. They can connect with other communities and forge new friendships. Whilst it is good to tap on the island-wide network, many residents have asked for quite some time, access to their local community sports facilities, such as their nearby school's running tracks, football fields and badminton courts. How deeply has the Ministry engaged our community partners in this regard? For the inaugural pilot, popular sports voted by the public will be chosen, and I hope MCCY can consider offering a broader spectrum of sports and games that covers a wider age group. Other factors that should be considered would be to adopt a multi-sport framework where the activities are varied in allowing people to get active and to maintain their interest. Whilst the concept of a Super Sports Club is a good one, can MCCY provide an update on the plans to roll out the concept? Hence, will the implementation of Super Sports Club affect the promotion of less popular sports? How will the Super Sports Club affect other sports clubs, such as the Community Sports Clubs, interest groups and providers of sports programmes? It is good to also know what are some of the benefits and events that the sports community can look forward to.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr Chairman, Sir, as we gear up for the challenges of an ageing population, it is also very important that we help empower and enable our seniors to lead full and purposeful lives. The good news is that the overwhelming majority of our seniors, in fact, more than 85% of them, are healthy and well, and eight in 10 of them believe in being active and to contribute to society. More than 60% who are aged between 55 and 64 are working. And for one in three households with young children, the grandparents are the main caregivers to their grandchildren. Hence, our perception of seniors and our shared vision with them must be to enable them to live happy, healthy and active lives, and to age that way, too. In that way, they can indeed live out that motto mentioned by Mr David Ong yesterday, that is, not only to add years to life but to add life to years. Let me cover what we as a Government can do to facilitate active ageing, in response to the comments made by Members – Mr Desmond Lee, Mr David Ong, Ms Denise Phua and Dr Lily Neo. However, let me also say at this juncture that what the Government can do is one part of it. It is an important part. It catalyses. But it requires support and active participation from the ground by our seniors in order that we can create this momentum, this groundswell, and make this into a movement and, therefore, affect the entire social landscape and change our society for the better for our seniors. The Wellness Programme is a key initiative introduced in 2008. So far, the Wellness Programme has benefited about 150,000 seniors aged 50 years and above. We have also set up the Seniors for Physical Activity (SPA) Committee in 2008 and that has promoted Brisk Walking, Health Qigong and Tai Chi to some 110,000 seniors. We have three goals in Wellness: empowering older persons to look after their health, to stay physically active, and to be good neighbours and friends to one another. We have decided to fold the SPA into the Wellness programme to reap synergies between the two. We are beginning to see the fruits of our efforts: (1) 40% of the seniors participating in the programme made more than 10 new friends and 36% said that they knew more than 10 neighbours after participating in the Wellness programme; (2) the number of seniors who attended 10 or more community activities or interest group activities in the past 12 months also increased from 8% to 34%; and (3) an evaluation of those who take part in the National Brisk Walking Programme done by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) found that these more active ones are 8% fitter than the national average. What makes the Wellness Programme potentially powerful is that the way it is done is not through organising periodic episodic large, staged mass events. Instead, it is anchored on small, organic interest groups with inherent strengths, and these meet regularly. First, ground up initiatives allow for diversity. Second, ties among seniors who meet regularly, initially over an interest, often blossom into support networks and friendship, and that makes participation emotionally fulfilling. This is why interest groups can create that momentum and that groundswell to turn active ageing into a movement. Page: 2462 Sixty-one-year old Mr Leong and his brisk walking interest group exemplify what I mean. After a major heart operation three years ago, he could barely walk. Nevertheless, with strong determination, he signed up for an exercise programme at a hospital and his health improved immensely. Yet, he did not stop there. Not only did he volunteer at the Jurong Central Wellness Site to influence others to take charge of their health, he became the group leader of the RC Fun Walker's Club. There, he influenced many others to become active and sparked a chain reaction that grew into a dynamic community. Going forward, we will roll out the Wellness Programme to all constituencies. We aim to reach one out of two citizens aged 50 and above by the year 2015, and we are talking about half a million people. The interaction between Government and the ground must be interactive, flexible and nimble. As we see gaps which are best filled by the agencies, we step in to develop the framework, channels and linkages. One case in point: we see synergy between the General Practitioner Network launched by the Health Promotion Board and the Wellness Programme. For example, a senior who needs to do medical follow-up after health screening may be referred to participate in physical activities and interest groups under the Wellness Programme. We are currently piloting this at Whampoa and we will be launching a new pilot in Marine Parade later this month. As we learn from these pilots, we will apply what we have learnt to other Wellness sites. We will also expand our menu. For one, we will introduce another form of mass participation. It is called the Dance-Fit. Seniors who sign up for Dance-Fit can choose from a comprehensive menu of line, social and folk dances. They learn a new dance and they can also enhance their dancing skills and form interest groups that build on the dance steps according to their interests and abilities. In doing so, we will start a new movement where more and more seniors can pick up dance to enjoy themselves, at the same time to bond and keep fit together regularly. In 2007, the Council for Third Age (C3A) was set up to champion active ageing and promote positive mindsets about ageing. C3A has touched more than 150,000 seniors and their family members last year. Through its Active Ager Awards and Active Ageing Festivals, C3A has opened the minds of older persons, and the young as well, as to what seniors can do, are doing and are capable of. Going forward, from feedback and consultations with seniors, C3A wants to support lifelong learning through interest groups and inter-generational learning. For example, the Young-at-Heart (YAH!) Community College brings seniors of similar interests together to engage in peer learning. C3A also piloted the Inter-generational Learning Programme, which pairs seniors with students in learning. The programme has helped bridge generational gaps and shape positive perceptions towards ageing and learning. We also want to cultivate a strong sporting culture among seniors. Under the Sports Vision 2030, we are developing a Seniors Fitness Ecosystem. We will identify sports that are popular among seniors. Seniors can gather with their family members and friends to learn, train and compete in a range of sports through \"Super Sports Clubs\". They will be able to participate in sports more confidently with the development of sports safety guidelines by the Health Promotion Board and the Singapore Sports Council. Seniors can also look forward to better designed facilities in the community, better suited for seniors. Page: 2463 You may have seen the Sports Vision 2030 promotion video. It features a group of seniors playing an energetic game of basketball. One of the seniors remarked: \"We may be old but we are young at heart.\" This is the spirit − the can-do, will-do spirit − that we want to continue to foster among our seniors. Ms Denise Phua spoke about ageing with purpose where seniors can play meaningful roles in society. I agree entirely with her. We want to promote volunteerism among seniors, and are working with the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC). Again, alluding to the \"ABCD\", an approach that Mr Laurence Lien spoke so passionately about, it is a good initiative and it facilitates platforms to be formed so that those with an asset, a skill, a talent, a network, an expertise, or a resource of some kind, can offer to leverage on that or make that available to the community and, together with other like-minded persons, develop that asset into a cluster of assets and make their community a better one, a warmer one, and a more caring one, by everybody for everyone. 1.15 pm What I have just shared is but a basic framework to continue to promote active ageing. To flesh it out, we must encourage, enable and embrace more ground-up initiatives. And the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Sam Tan, will later share an example of this in Mandarin. Sir, let us together, with and for our seniors, achieve what Mr Desmond Lee calls the \"silver summer\" of happy, healthy and active ageing. And by doing so, we will have taken yet another concrete step towards living long, living well and with peace of mind.</td>\n",

I always say we are so blessed to be living in Singapore where ladies are well respected and treated fairly. I cannot ask for more. Mr Chairman, in a 2018 June article from the Straits Times, Minister Grace Fu said that, \"Singapore hopes to double its volunteerism rate from one in three currently to 70 per cent in five years' time\". This is a laudable goal to aim for, and I believe it can come to fruition through a combination of various factors. As citizens of Singapore, we all take responsibility for our lives and actions. The Government does not believe in giving handouts and it is the civic duty of citizens to help the less fortunate in our country. Currently, the rate of volunteerism in Singapore has grown from 9% in 2000 to 35% in 2016, with the total volunteer hours doubling from 66 million hours in 2014 to 121 million hours in 2016. As it is, the benefits of volunteerism are manifold. It is a source of significant contribution to the global economy. According to statistics from the Johns Hopkins Centre for Civil Society Studies in 2011, approximately 140 million people in the 37 countries engage in volunteer work in a typical year. It is estimated that volunteers contribute around $400 billion to the global economy annually. Apart from economic contribution, volunteerism also enhances social connections between different sectors, and builds bridges across Governments, enterprises and employees. It encourages citizens to be more active in civic engagement and mindful of their role in society. Positive effects on volunteers as individuals includes increases in self-esteem, enhanced emotional skills and capacities, expansion in career paths and an overall healthier physique and mentality. However, there are various influencing factors at play in Singapore which reduce the take up rate of volunteering. Chiefly among these is the reason that citizens have no time to volunteer. They fail to understand that giving to others does not mean having less time for oneself. As a result, fewer are giving up their time and effort to volunteer for a good cause, even though donations are substantial. As Singapore faces an ageing population crisis, it is even more crucial that youths are being engaged to volunteer with the elderly population. With the SG Cares platform, it is possible to match an individual's community work with volunteering opportunities of their choice. It is heartening to see a sixteen-fold increase in youths' participation from 2009 to 2019, with youths making up almost 80% of the volunteers registered on the website. So, this begs the question: how can we further encourage the increase in number and depth of volunteerism in our nation? I would like to propose that we attract business and public sector leaders who are retired or close to retirement to volunteer. This draws from a large pool of ageing population with longer life expectancy, who are highly educated, active and financially secure. They are also proven managers of people, finances and complex programmes, who understand the benefits of meaningful work and are motivated to contribute to society. The knowledge, experience and energy that these leaders bring represent a significant potential resource for the non-profit and charitable sector. The result is a win-win situation which benefits both the community and retired leaders themselves, as volunteers generally enjoy improved health and wellness in the form of personal accomplishment and lower levels of depression. To attract these leaders, I would like to propose a two-pronged approach. Firstly, it is necessary to build a pre-retirement awareness of volunteering. An effective way is to locate and extend a personal invitation to leaders who are retired or will be retired in five years' time. The second approach would be to design suitable volunteer opportunities. We should create awareness of the complete range of volunteer opportunities offered, and then ensure that volunteer opportunities have specific targets and deliverables. Volunteers would be more attracted to activities with clear job descriptions, well defined expectations and timelines. Short-term volunteer opportunities can also be offered to those with competing interests and limited available time. Nevertheless, the most important aspect of attracting any form of volunteers will inevitably start with us. We as leaders of the nation are duty-bound to lead by example and be a visible beacon on the frontlines. Only after being volunteers ourselves can we be exemplars and speak with passion about the great joy volunteerism can bring, in order to galvanise fellow citizens to be authentic volunteers. Personally, I have been a pharmacist volunteer at a local Hospice for the past 20 years. Our volunteer pharmacists take turns every Saturday to visit the institution to sort out medication waste and monitor inventory of medications. On the days when it is my turn, I will bring along one of my four children to help out. I task them to perform the \"first cut\" expiry date stock check while I sort out bags of medication waste for appropriate disposal and check on stock levels to trigger ordering. The aim is to attempt to engage them from young to appreciate the spirit of volunteering, though I will still re-check after them. At the end of our duty, as we walk along the corridor on our way out, I will ask my child to \"peek\" into a patient's room. I explain to them how the two hours spent earlier has helped to ensure that these terminally ill patients don't run out of essential medications, and are not taking expired drugs which may affect their pain control, vomiting or infection. Ensuring appropriate disposal of these medications also has significant impact on protecting our environment and safety of our residents. Seeing the patients comfortable in bed during their last days can be especially emotional and underscores the heartfelt importance of the work that we are doing. And this is what has kept me going for the past 20 years as a volunteer. Volunteerism should be a life-time commitment, not simply a once-off Community Involvement project. It is a calling and must come from the heart. As a community leader and a mother who wants my young children to espouse the values of volunteerism, it also starts with us as leaders to shape the roads for successive generations to follow. The greatest leader is also the most willing servant. Mr Chairman, I would like to leave you with a quote from MK Gandhi: \"The best way to find yourself, is to lose yourself in the service of others.\"\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Today, the global environment is more fractious and societies are increasingly polarised. Disruptive technologies are changing our economies, our jobs, our way of life and challenging our norms. Singapore is a global city state that is multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and in some way multinational is at the epicentre of these forces. If we are not careful, these global forces can exert tensions that will threaten, disrupt and test the strength of the fabric of our society. While MCCY has done well in fostering a strong sense of national unity and pride through sectors of arts, youth, community and sports, new challenges such as the COVID-19, regional political turmoil and international trade tensions are always emerging and we must be prepared to remain resilient and stay united as one Singapore. MCCY must continue to strengthen the social fabric and the solidarity in the face of these forces. Are the current MCCY's strategies still relevant in the building an inclusive home where everyone feels that we are equal members of the same community, and are given equal opportunities to thrive and to pursue one's passion and interest? Given the increasing diversity and fractious state of our society, can we continue to progress together as a people? What unites us as one people, one nation? Is it the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave when Singapore Lions beat Pahang during the 1994 Malaysian cup? Or the 50.39 secs that Joseph Schooling swam while we all held our breath in front of our TV screens during the 2016 Olympics? Or the nail-biting table tennis finals during the 2008 Olympics when our paddlers brought us a silver medal? We wept as a nation as we mourned together during the passing of our beloved founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 2015. People of all walks of life regarding of race, language or religion came together to queue for hours under the weather, rain or shine, day or night, to pay their last respect. We faced fear and death together during the 2003 SARS crisis which infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Today, we are again tested and challenged and tested with COVID-19. We are tackling these challenges together and collectively with resolute and resilience. As we continue to progress, the natural fault lines in our society – socio-economic divide, racial and religious divide, ideology divide, sexual orientation divide, e-literacy divide and many more – will continue to exist and may surface from time to time to threaten our resolve and unity. Will we be able to rise to the occasion like previous challenges and emerge stronger or will we be divided and withered? MCCY needs to intensify the efforts in building a home that provides opportunities for all. It is important while we embrace our diversity and differences as strength of our nation, we need to work hard to create and expand common spaces and experiences that is unique to Singapore. To do this, I have three suggestions. One, use arts, culture and heritage unique to Singapore. Make of arts and cultural programmes more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans. Similar to the $100 Active SG credits for sports facilities, MCCY can consider giving all Singaporeans $100 Active Arts and Culture credit to attend arts and cultural courses or attend local arts & cultural performances. Two, renew and remake of community clubs to remain relevant so that more Singaporeans will visit and use the CCs. Our CCs should be the Community Centre for arts, culture, wellness and health, social interactions and skills upgrading. Three, expand and build up community sports that can unite and bring people together. Top up the Active SG credits on a regular basis to promote community sports and expand the use of Active credits to sports events attendance, including our SG football leagues and national sports events. Chairman, building a home that provide opportunities for all is not just an ideal. It is a reality. It is a basic right for all Singaporeans. I would like to thank MCCY for their hard work and invite all Singaporeans from all walks of life to join MCCY to make this arduous task a reality. Question proposed.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mr Chairman, I would like to declare that I am on the Boards of SISTIC and Esplanade. Artists, musicians and their work give meaning to the complex world in which we live. During the lockdown, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli performed at an empty Milan Cathedral and lifted the spirits of millions around the world. Museums offered free virtual tours to all who needed a culture fix while self-isolating. And I joined Singaporeans all across the island to belt out in solidarity from our balconies, Dick Lee’s “Home Truly”. Indeed, like Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech, “Human beings need the arts and culture to nourish our souls”. The arts and culture industry is amongst the hardest hit by COVID-19. Creative people are, however, resilient people, and the “show must go on\". Many have pivoted to teaching, and of course, going digital is inevitable. SISTIC, for example, had to pivot quickly so as to support our Arts groups and venues to go online. Esplanade and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) were amongst the first to pilot with ticketed livestream performances here, and viewers, including global audiences, were delighted to consume Singapore arts content during the circuit breaker. To go digital, artists need a digital stage but tech resources are scarce and funding is needed, especially since many in the creative sector are gig workers, self-employed professionals (SEPs) and SMEs. A young Singaporean woman composer/musician, NyaLi shared with me her gratitude for the “Geylang Serai Arts Platform” which helped her to go digital. I was encouraged to hear NyaLi tell me that she signed up for a course on Digital Marketing and is also using her talents to help the disadvantaged. COVID-19 is the burning platform that drives businesses and professionals across all sectors to digitalise, to reskill and to transform; and the Arts is no exception. Does MCCY plan to scale platforms like Geylang Serai? Will MCCY support with more shared space for ideation and experimentation? Is it in MCCY’s plans to bring the creative and tech talents together to co-create new innovative models for the Arts? Performances have started to come back but audience max at 250 people and in \"bubble wrap seating\". It does not look like large scale events and lounge performances will return in the near future. Does the $45 million Resilience Package, which is much appreciated, support the gig workers and SEPs in our creative industries? And can the social and wellness industries tap on our creative talents? Sir, the creative value-chain – from artists to production houses, from promoters to event organisers, from venues to ticketing agents, from designers to art and music teachers – all contribute to Singapore's creative capital, that is, Singapore’s “soft power”. I hope that Singaporeans, corporates, the Government and the creative community themselves can come together to strengthen and grow our Singapore creative capital. Now that we even have a University of the Arts, what would have to be true for our creative capital to turn to gold for Singapore, like what K-pop and K-drama did for Korea? And on that note, let me close with the lyrics from one of NyaLi’s COVID-19 singles: “The world is big and we are small; geography can be so cruel; but I’d like to think that love stands up; tall and proud on her own.” Thank you and I wish everyone Happy International Women’s Day!\n",
       "1538   At the outset, I would like to declare that I am Chairman of the SNOC's Athletes' Commission; Member of the Olympic Council of Asian's Athlete Committee; Honorary Secretary of Olympians Singapore and Director of Secretariat at the Global Esports Federation My first cut relates to the development of a skills framework for the sports and fitness industry. It is undeniable that for an industry to grow and thrive, it must be set up in an environment that is conducive for such growth. The necessary conditions must be there to make people to want to join the industry and develop it. My question today is, are these conditions present for the sports and fitness industry and can more be done to facilitate this growth? To my mind, the industry could do well to develop a framework that is competency and skills oriented. Countries like the UK and Australia already have frameworks in place that require employers to hire coaches and fitness trainers who complete specified vocational courses. Further, to get a better sense of the industry's specific needs, the focus should be on engaging the people who do the work daily. The demands of the industry are everchanging and it would be difficult for the Government machinery to keep pace with the dynamic demands. Say, nutrition. There are many fads out there – the keto diet, Atkins diet, the list goes on. Would HPB be able to keep coming up with the requisite courses to train people in these areas? The short answer is that it would be difficult and costly. Sports and fitness is a multi-faceted industry and a cookie-cutter approach would be difficult to apply. So, considering the industry's needs and the existing infrastructure already in place, I would suggest a skills framework to be developed by the sports industry, for the sports industry, with the full support of the Singapore Government. This would lead to a meaningful growth in a more cost-effective and targeted way. Chairman, my second cut relates to the JSS for the sports and fitness sector. In my Budget debate speech, I highlighted that the pandemic has severely hit the sports, fitness and wellness industry. Although Singapore is easing into phase 3, sports and fitness academies and establishments are not able to fully open due to social distancing measures. Pool space is reduced, school programmes and facilities are limited, and gyms cannot operate to efficient capacities. Also, establishments located in retail facilities still have the added pressure of rental. Some gym operators are reporting as low as 50% revenues compared to pre-COVID 19 levels. Because of this, I would like MCCY to consider upgrading the sports and fitness industry from tier 3 to Tier 2 for JSS support. I would also like to thank Minister at MCCY for recognising the sector and for extending more support to the industry through the Sports Innovation Grant and Operating Grant extension to December 2021. This will complement the JSS. My third cut is on the development of the e-sports industry in Singapore. Chairman, it is my pleasure to speak on the emergence and progress of e-sports in Singapore today. I would like to not only talk about e-sports through the lens of the future but about the possibilities for Singapore today, as the future has indeed arrived on our shores. Today, large-scale e-sports tournaments draw more viewers than \"traditional sports\". For instance, the League of Legends World Championships held in Shanghai in late 2020, drew more than 46 million viewers. The world has also come to recognise e-sports as part of the sports eco-system. Recently, the Olympic Council of Asia confirmed that the Asian Games would offer a programme where e-sports has its place as a full medal event in 2022. E-sports is one of the sectors which has grown rapidly and accelerated during the pandemic. With viewership and gaming participation currently at all-time highs, and in a time where content is king, you can expect e-sports to be here to stay. The e-sports industry currently sees double-digit growth and such growth has found its way into the Singapore landscape. With Singapore's strong local infrastructure, like fast and stable Internet, top global teams have found Singapore very conducive for their professional team training. There are more than 20 full-time professional players here, with the top 10 having made more than $3 million in prize winnings alone. This figure does not include salaries and sponsorships. There are also others employed as full-time coaches and managers of local teams as well as professional teams in major markets like the US and China. Looking ahead, top e-sports events in Singapore are expected to spend at least $30 million in 2021. This will boost many local start-ups and businesses in media, events and supporting services. Promising local start-ups like yup.gg and EVOS have between them raised more than $31 million in investments and we can expect many more to follow in their footsteps. They look on track to follow successful local-born companies like Sea and Razer, who grew a good part of their business thanks to e-sports and gaming, creating thousands of jobs in the process. Multinational companies in the e-sports and gaming industry like Tencent, Ubisoft and Moonton have also set up regional offices here in Singapore. They are expected to introduce hundreds of jobs in the coming year. On a sports administrative front, we welcomed the world to the launch of the Global Esports Federation (GEF) on 16 December 2019 to convene the world's e-sports eco-system right here in Singapore. That very same day, we welcomed the world's largest gaming company and technology giant, Tencent, as the founding global partner of the GEF. Having Tencent with us has helped propel plans into reality. The vision of Tencent's leadership saw them join the GEF as its very first partner and, in less than a year later, to establish its regional hub right here in Singapore. The GEF launch, watched by over 940 million people across the globe, crystalised in our minds the power, potential and reach of e-sports around the world. For us at home in Singapore, we saw opportunities—it is not gaming and e-sports alone but the large, growing eco-system around it. The possibilities are boundless across education, events, health and wellness initiatives, technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation. With these developments, I believe Singapore can and should do more to take on a leading role in shaping the industry. Mr Chairman, my remarks today come with a sense of optimism and opportunity, hope, and genuine excitement for the future. I believe the future of e-sports is incredibly bright if we gather our knowledge, listen to each other and help shape the future together. E-sports is alive, it is real and it is evolving at an ever-increasing pace. Indeed, e-sports can offer a space for everyone and it makes good business and economic sense. The possibilities are boundless if we seize the opportunities we have been given and which we helped create. We intend to host the annual Global Esports Games in December 2021 and every year after that. A rich portfolio of events will fill the calendar with a global platform for competition and entertainment. This event offers another excellent opportunity for Singapore to welcome the world and shape how the world consumes live events. My sincere hope is that Singapore's e-sports community will grow and prosper and better e-sports globally to benefit athletes, players, teams and other stakeholders in our community. Just as the Olympic Movement values elevate sports, we hope to highlight and bring out the best in e-sports. Mr Chairman, my last cut relates to creating our sporting heritage. In my Budget debate speech, I took the opportunity to recognise our past athletes who had done Singapore proud in times when resources were scarce and inspired generations after them to take on the mantle and fly Singapore's flag high on the world stage. Olympians and national athletes in the earlier decades had to resort to their own resources to help sustain and balance earning a living and competing in sports. Incentive programmes such as the Major Games Award Programme were established in the 1990s, which do not confer retrospective recognition. More can be done to recognise and help these athletes who contributed to Singapore's sporting glory and paved the way for future generations to succeed. Currently, there is no system to help keep retired athletes engaged in the national programmes, save for Olympians Singapore. I honestly believe that athletes want to continue to give back to their fraternity and inspire Singaporeans. Indeed, when an athlete retires, there is no engagement beyond that. Many athletes have gone on to establish themselves in the corporate and business world. They would likely hire ex-national athletes and sponsor programmes – they were from the system, after all. It is a waste that this is not done. My thoughts are that heritage is closely linked with culture. Just as we reminisce on the glory of the Kallang Roar, we must remain cognisant that youth today may not know what that means. We have a sports heritage in that the current generations can stand on our past sporting giants' shoulders. I hope MCCY can do more to recognise and engage past athletes.\n",

At the same time, we cannot underestimate the innovation that the arts and culture sectors spur across the economy. With wellness and inclusion as key focuses, the arts and culture also offer channels for positive social impact. They encourage education about Singapore’s identity and as well as revitalise our city life. Yet, the arts and culture sector has been hard-hit by the pandemic and has been severely disrupted by it. In addition to short-term support for artists and firms, which comes from both the public and private sector, policies can also leverage the economic and social impacts of culture in their broader recovery packages and efforts to transform our economy. With COVID-19, digital presentations have provided a lifeline, allowing audiences a new experience in the consumption of the arts. The digital space has provided both opportunities and challenges for local arts groups as they overcome the safe distancing measures and cross into a digital space that is not limited by physical boundaries. Yet, there is also a need to reimagine the business models used in the arts and culture sector so that they are sustainable. Offering free programmes worked for the short-run but the arts also need to be monetised. Effort needs to be placed on the protection of intellectual property in the digital space. Manpower planning and growth are also crucial as the arts groups rethink on how to increase capabilities to augment the production quality of digital works. Additionally, talent needs to be boosted through the exploration of new ways of blending digital formats with real-life arts and culture offerings. Training programmes for freelancers and collaborations with the private sector players are some of the ways to further talent growth to ensure sustained development of the arts and culture sectors. What are MCCY’s strategies to revitalise the arts and culture sectors and ensure that our organisations and freelancers are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal? Can MCCY provide an update on the impact of ACRP and the support provided to organisations and freelancers? Can MCCY elaborate on its plans to further strengthen the socio-economic nexus of our arts and culture sector, including manpower development and plans for digitalisation, to ensure that our artists are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal? The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on sports participation on many levels, including the cancelling or scaling down of mass participation events. Safe distancing measures as well as concerns about the danger of large clusters forming have had an impact on sports participation. At the same time, there are new developments in sports aimed at coping with the limitations of safe distancing measures. Capacity constraints in sporting venues and the limitations on the way team sport can be engaged has resulted in innovations. An example of innovative approaches to physical space are emerging, such as the use of small box gyms that offer physical fitness enthusiasts a new and different lease of life. Yet, sports and the communal nature of many sporting activities has a huge role to play in the psycho-social aspects of life. These benefits include cooperation, coping with confidence and shyness issues, dealing with stress and coping with aggression and violence. Sports can help curb social isolation and serve as a catharsis or outlet for those dealing with emotional issues. Sports also play a critical and important role in bringing Singaporeans together. Sports, whether it is through participation or spectatorship, foster a sense of pride and builds a confident nation, through interaction with athletes or sports fan bases. To paraphrase Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, \"The important thing in life is not the triumph, but the fight; the essential thing is not to have won, but to have fought well.” So, in this regard, sports can be used to develop an individuals’ resilience as well. Can MCCY share its strategies to bring sports participation back into the new normal? Can MCCY share its strategies to restore and reinvigorate national sports participation, increase access to sports facilities, and reintroduce mass sport events in a safe manner? Sports has the ability to reinforce the idea of the importance of equality. For the fourth Paralympics in a row, Singapore’s para-athletes have come back with a haul of medals in spite of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Athletes, such as Yip Pin Xiu and Paraglider Jessica Goh, have gunned for gold, winning the hearts of Singaporeans. Other para-athletes, such as archer Nur Syahidah Alim, cyclists Steve Tee and competition partner Ang Kee Meng, have shown how sports can build an inclusive society through opportunities for talent to shine. In October last year, it was reported that Yip Pin Xiu will receive $800,000 for the two gold medals she won at the Tokyo Paralympic Games in August 2021. It is, indeed, commendable that sponsors, such as DBS and the Tote Board, have stepped in with the cash awards to help the athletes and reward them for their sacrifice. The work of the Singapore National Paralympic Council (SNPC), which focuses on enabling our elite para-athletes to participate in major games, such as the ASEAN Para Games, Asian Para Games, Asian Youth Para Games, Commonwealth Games and Paralympic Games, has also been crucial as the SNPC has undertaken collaborations to enable our para-athletes to soar. It is important to leverage on the international success of these para-athletes to encourage more sports participation at all levels. So, what is MCCY doing to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports? In line with MCCY’s commitment at the Parliament motion last year to honour our athletes, what is MCCY doing to support para-athletes and provide more opportunities for our aspiring para-athletes, especially for those who wish to pursue sports at a competitive level to represent Singapore in the international arena? Can MCCY also elaborate on its strategies to provide more inclusiveness through sports in the next phase of the Disability Sports Master Plan? In sports it is not the will to win that matters but the will to prepare to win according to Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, the late American football coach. At some of the major games such as the Southeast Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games, major games preparation is an important ingredient in the athletes’ preparation to enhance performance and recovery. Madam, these games and the results achieved can only be reinforced through advance planning and real-time involvement and investment in scientific methods. Effort also needs to be placed on minimising the distractions and stress faced by athletes during games time, enabling them to focus on their performance. There is also much behind-the scenes work by organisations such as Sports Singapore and the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) that have collaborated to prepare for major games to deliver preparation plans, games preparation workshops, performance analysis. Enhanced sports medicine as well as sports science are being employed to support athletes in their games preparations. There is also the need to invest time and funds in coaching and providing the best in terms of infrastructure, programmes and sports facilities so that our athletes can thrive, stress-free and focused on delivering an optimum performance. Mdm Chairan, given the pressures that they face, athletes’ mental health is just as crucial so that they can deal with the pressure that intense competition brings. All this preparation and investment is only meaningful and only possible if there is psychological support for the athletes and their efforts. Can MCCY provide an update on how Team Singapore athletes are progressing in their preparation for the major games in 2022 and beyond? What efforts are underway to rally Singaporeans to support Team Singapore. Sports has the potential to galvanise and inspire the nation? Can MCCY share its efforts to rally Singaporeans to show their support for Team Singapore, and also to provide platforms for Team Singapore athletes to connect with and inspire Singaporeans?\n",

For the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, Team Singapore fielded 10 athletes across six sports, to compete with the world's best and represent Singapore at the highest sporting showcase. In October last year, this House resolved a Motion to congratulate Team Singapore Olympians and Paralympians for their achievements. For the Bahrain Asian Youth Para Games, Singapore sent 13 athletes and the amazing team made the nation proud by bringing back five gold, three silver and two bronze medals. Our para athletes have been an inspiration to us all. They show us what it means to defy the odds and what is possible when you are not defined or constrained by physical limitations. We can and should draw from their example to encourage more participation in sports in Singapore, especially among persons with disabilities (PWDs). I am happy to hear about the Para Sport Academy but beyond the high performance sporting participation, we should look at how we can facilitate regular participation in sport activities by improving access and creating more opportunities for PWDs to be involved. There are many good reasons for this. For one, sport activities are a good way to keep healthy. We heard yesterday at the MOH COS debate about preventive health and physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Sport activities not only help with physical wellness but also mental well-being as participants interact with others and build relationships through their interactions. Secondly, sports can be so empowering for PWDs. With facilitation and proper guidance, PWDs can acquire useful social skills and build up their confidence as they participate in sport activities that they enjoy. Thirdly, there is so much potential to promote inclusiveness through sports. Sports is a social leveller that does not distinguish between educational levels, socio-economic status, race or religion. It helps bring together people from all walks of life. We can support and cheer for each other and use common facilities together. This would help normalise different abilities and open doors to better appreciation and understanding of differences. I note that there have been efforts on this front. There is a Disability Sports Master Plan in place setting the roadmap for various initiatives. There are inclusive gyms and several disability sports programmes and also efforts by SportsSG. I also understand that various stakeholders like Singapore Disability Sports Council and MOE work with SportsSG to enable talent development in disability sports and strengthen capabilities in the ecosystem. I would like to understand if we have been tracking our progress. Have there been developments on inclusive physical exercise and disability sports programmes? Is knowledge and expertise in tailoring sports activities for PWDs and organising inclusive sports programmes sufficiently widespread? I hope the Ministry can share its plans to leverage on sports to make Singapore a more inclusive society. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about much disruption and challenges to all, including our youth. Our young people had to contend with significant changes in their educational journey and there was a particularly specific impact for those who were in certain courses of study or at the tail end of their formal education. They had to quickly adjust to learning online, with less interaction with teachers and other students. It was especially challenging for those in technical courses where hands-on learning is important. Internship programmes had to be adjusted as firms implemented work-from-home arrangements. Those who had planned to study overseas or go for an exchange programme had their plans disrupted. Prospects for some industries appeared bleak as the economy pivoted and some wondered about their choice of study and career prospects. This caused much anxiety and uncertainty. Some young people I spoke to expressed how the pandemic robbed them of their opportunities and youth. The impact on their mental well-being was indeed significant. According to the NYC Youth Statistics in Brief 2020, the youth labour force participation rates for the year 2019 was 61% for ages 20 to 24; 90.1% for ages 25 to 29; 92.3% for ages 30 to 34. According to the MOM report in June 2021, the youth unemployment rate climbed in 2020. Annual average resident youth unemployment rate hit 10.6%, 1.8% higher than during the 2009 global financial crisis and 1.3% higher than during the 2003 SARS pandemic. While the situation is challenging for those transiting from school to work, I feel that our youth have shown a lot of resilience in overcoming their situation. There may be industries affected but there are many opportunities abound and new growth areas. It is important, therefore, to strategically look at how we can support youth to seize the opportunities and provide them with the relevant insights so that they are motivated and have the necessary information to make decisions for their future. Mentors, especially in growth sectors, can play a meaningful role in this effort. I am a strong believer in mentoring. I support the efforts of Mentoring Alliance Singapore and oversee the youth empowerment and mentoring programmes under M3. I do not think I need to extol the virtues of mentoring to this House. We all know the value of having that someone in your life to give guidance and motivation as you venture into new unknown and challenging areas. I would like though, to emphasise the importance of mentoring in opening world views and nudging young people to explore possibilities. This is especially significant for families of certain economic status, where their children do not benefit from the social capital of those who are more well-to-do or well-connected. Their world view may be circumscribed by what they see their parents do. Even if they get inspired by someone they read or hear about in the news, they do not know how to get there, how to achieve the same things. Given the current evolution of the economy post-pandemic, it is timely, in fact more urgent now, to train people from various growing industries to become mentors. Further, not everyone is as fortunate to meet a mentor who can guide her along. We need to make sure that every young person has access to the support she needs. There are a lot more programmes and opportunities now as compared to the time when I was in school. We could continue to improve on this by creating an ecosystem and culture of mentoring in Singapore. That way, every young person will have access to mentors and when they grow older, may be mentors themselves. Aside from educational development and career prospects, it is important to also look into the emotional development and resilience of youth. There is a lot of awareness now about mental well-being and its impact on the holistic development of an individual. We should garner the insights and build that in as part of the training of mentors or mentoring programmes. I, therefore, hope that MCCY can look at efforts to develop a more strategic and current mentoring framework for our youth. I believe with these efforts, we can continue to encourage our youth to be resilient and hopeful for the future.\n",

part of the Government's overall efforts to secure a sustainable future for Singapore, can MCCY elaborate on its plans to ensure a greener and more sustainable sports ecosystem? In my previous green, sustainability-related Parliamentary speeches, I have shared my firm belief that community involvement plays a vital role in our overall nations efforts towards SG Green Plan 2030 through our collective efforts and embracing an eco-friendly lifestyle and greenify the environment. In order to achieve that, the Government needs to set up the right hardware and co-create the green software. Active SG Woodlands Sports Centre situated in our Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC is one such example. A community farm was actually set up right next to its swimming pool and is being cared for by a team of passionate Team Nila Volunteers as well as members of the public living around the vicinity of Marsiling and Woodgrove. The ground-up recycling effort at this community farm is commendable. Most of the fittings there are actually recycled items contributed and creatively put together by residents and ActiveSG staff. They have also exhibited their innovativeness by harvesting rainwater to irrigate the greens. These green farming activities not only keep the members active and fit but also build a strong kampong spirit as they routinely contribute the harvest to the vulnerable groups in our community along with sharing their green tips to other community gardens within the neighbourhood. Are there any other plans for Sport SG to roll out up similar green concepts to other sports centres across Singapore? How else does MCCY intend to involve the sports community, Singaporeans and partners from the private sectors to co-create solutions for sustainability and play a part in these efforts. Minister Edwin Tong has previously shared in his views that our young people are a crucial segment of our society. The youths of today are the leaders of tomorrow. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister. Our youths are the people who must have a say in the kind of society they want to be in it and should play an active role in shaping Singapore's future. Youths today, however, faced many uncertainties, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic and other global issues. Many of them are also in transitions through different life stages. These have placed a significant amount of stress on our young people, especially in areas such as job prospects, finances and mental well-being. Despite these challenges, we have witnessed many of them will have tirelessly volunteered their time and effort in serving the vulnerable groups in our community during this eventful period. I am particularly grateful to the youths in our Woodgrove community. Despite facing their own challenges, they have organised mental wellness talks to motivate others to stay positive, distributed \"Return to School\" care packs to low-income group children, hosted upcycling \"Go Green\" workshops and planned many clean-up estate initiatives to raise empathy for our cleaners. Can MCCY share what is done to support youths' concerns and needs in their key priority areas? How does the whole Government intend to work together to support youths in navigating their various life stages and transitions? What has also been done to provide opportunities and support to our youths of different cultures and backgrounds to continue contributing to the community and mold the future of our Singapore, despite the present challenges that each of them may be facing now?\n",

the Basketball Association of Singapore. Under Vision 2030, the concept of a \"Super Sports Club\" was surfaced to extend the reach of quality sporting programmes and events to all Singaporeans. Leveraging on the enhanced sports facilities, the Super Sports Club provides an island-wide integrated network of sports programming, events, competitions and places for people to enjoy sports. The Super Sports Club allows for the community to embrace \"fitness for life\" and a sporting culture, which will reap social dividends, in particular, in areas of health, wellness, active ageing and community bonding. For the more serious sportsmen or women, they can now take to competitive sports. Others can have access to players and places to practise and play their sports beyond school or competitive days. Our seniors can also benefit tremendously by being physically and socially active through sports. They can connect with other communities and forge new friendships. Whilst it is good to tap on the island-wide network, many residents have asked for quite some time, access to their local community sports facilities, such as their nearby school's running tracks, football fields and badminton courts. How deeply has the Ministry engaged our community partners in this regard? For the inaugural pilot, popular sports voted by the public will be chosen, and I hope MCCY can consider offering a broader spectrum of sports and games that covers a wider age group. Other factors that should be considered would be to adopt a multi-sport framework where the activities are varied in allowing people to get active and to maintain their interest. Whilst the concept of a Super Sports Club is a good one, can MCCY provide an update on the plans to roll out the concept? Hence, will the implementation of Super Sports Club affect the promotion of less popular sports? How will the Super Sports Club affect other sports clubs, such as the Community Sports Clubs, interest groups and providers of sports programmes? It is good to also know what are some of the benefits and events that the sports community can look forward to.\n",

The good news is that the overwhelming majority of our seniors, in fact, more than 85% of them, are healthy and well, and eight in 10 of them believe in being active and to contribute to society. More than 60% who are aged between 55 and 64 are working. And for one in three households with young children, the grandparents are the main caregivers to their grandchildren. Hence, our perception of seniors and our shared vision with them must be to enable them to live happy, healthy and active lives, and to age that way, too. In that way, they can indeed live out that motto mentioned by Mr David Ong yesterday, that is, not only to add years to life but to add life to years. Let me cover what we as a Government can do to facilitate active ageing, in response to the comments made by Members – Mr Desmond Lee, Mr David Ong, Ms Denise Phua and Dr Lily Neo. However, let me also say at this juncture that what the Government can do is one part of it. It is an important part. It catalyses. But it requires support and active participation from the ground by our seniors in order that we can create this momentum, this groundswell, and make this into a movement and, therefore, affect the entire social landscape and change our society for the better for our seniors. The Wellness Programme is a key initiative introduced in 2008. So far, the Wellness Programme has benefited about 150,000 seniors aged 50 years and above. We have also set up the Seniors for Physical Activity (SPA) Committee in 2008 and that has promoted Brisk Walking, Health Qigong and Tai Chi to some 110,000 seniors. We have three goals in Wellness: empowering older persons to look after their health, to stay physically active, and to be good neighbours and friends to one another. We have decided to fold the SPA into the Wellness programme to reap synergies between the two. We are beginning to see the fruits of our efforts: (1) 40% of the seniors participating in the programme made more than 10 new friends and 36% said that they knew more than 10 neighbours after participating in the Wellness programme; (2) the number of seniors who attended 10 or more community activities or interest group activities in the past 12 months also increased from 8% to 34%; and (3) an evaluation of those who take part in the National Brisk Walking Programme done by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) found that these more active ones are 8% fitter than the national average. What makes the Wellness Programme potentially powerful is that the way it is done is not through organising periodic episodic large, staged mass events. Instead, it is anchored on small, organic interest groups with inherent strengths, and these meet regularly. First, ground up initiatives allow for diversity. Second, ties among seniors who meet regularly, initially over an interest, often blossom into support networks and friendship, and that makes participation emotionally fulfilling. This is why interest groups can create that momentum and that groundswell to turn active ageing into a movement. Page: 2462 Sixty-one-year old Mr Leong and his brisk walking interest group exemplify what I mean. After a major heart operation three years ago, he could barely walk. Nevertheless, with strong determination, he signed up for an exercise programme at a hospital and his health improved immensely. Yet, he did not stop there. Not only did he volunteer at the Jurong Central Wellness Site to influence others to take charge of their health, he became the group leader of the RC Fun Walker's Club. There, he influenced many others to become active and sparked a chain reaction that grew into a dynamic community. Going forward, we will roll out the Wellness Programme to all constituencies. We aim to reach one out of two citizens aged 50 and above by the year 2015, and we are talking about half a million people. The interaction between Government and the ground must be interactive, flexible and nimble. As we see gaps which are best filled by the agencies, we step in to develop the framework, channels and linkages. One case in point: we see synergy between the General Practitioner Network launched by the Health Promotion Board and the Wellness Programme. For example, a senior who needs to do medical follow-up after health screening may be referred to participate in physical activities and interest groups under the Wellness Programme. We are currently piloting this at Whampoa and we will be launching a new pilot in Marine Parade later this month. As we learn from these pilots, we will apply what we have learnt to other Wellness sites. We will also expand our menu. For one, we will introduce another form of mass participation. It is called the Dance-Fit. Seniors who sign up for Dance-Fit can choose from a comprehensive menu of line, social and folk dances. They learn a new dance and they can also enhance their dancing skills and form interest groups that build on the dance steps according to their interests and abilities. In doing so, we will start a new movement where more and more seniors can pick up dance to enjoy themselves, at the same time to bond and keep fit together regularly. In 2007, the Council for Third Age (C3A) was set up to champion active ageing and promote positive mindsets about ageing. C3A has touched more than 150,000 seniors and their family members last year. Through its Active Ager Awards and Active Ageing Festivals, C3A has opened the minds of older persons, and the young as well, as to what seniors can do, are doing and are capable of. Going forward, from feedback and consultations with seniors, C3A wants to support lifelong learning through interest groups and inter-generational learning. For example, the Young-at-Heart (YAH!) Community College brings seniors of similar interests together to engage in peer learning. C3A also piloted the Inter-generational Learning Programme, which pairs seniors with students in learning. The programme has helped bridge generational gaps and shape positive perceptions towards ageing and learning. We also want to cultivate a strong sporting culture among seniors. Under the Sports Vision 2030, we are developing a Seniors Fitness Ecosystem. We will identify sports that are popular among seniors. Seniors can gather with their family members and friends to learn, train and compete in a range of sports through \"Super Sports Clubs\". They will be able to participate in sports more confidently with the development of sports safety guidelines by the Health Promotion Board and the Singapore Sports Council. Seniors can also look forward to better designed facilities in the community, better suited for seniors. Page: 2463 You may have seen the Sports Vision 2030 promotion video. It features a group of seniors playing an energetic game of basketball. One of the seniors remarked: \"We may be old but we are young at heart.\" This is the spirit − the can-do, will-do spirit − that we want to continue to foster among our seniors. Ms Denise Phua spoke about ageing with purpose where seniors can play meaningful roles in society. I agree entirely with her. We want to promote volunteerism among seniors, and are working with the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC). Again, alluding to the \"ABCD\", an approach that Mr Laurence Lien spoke so passionately about, it is a good initiative and it facilitates platforms to be formed so that those with an asset, a skill, a talent, a network, an expertise, or a resource of some kind, can offer to leverage on that or make that available to the community and, together with other like-minded persons, develop that asset into a cluster of assets and make their community a better one, a warmer one, and a more caring one, by everybody for everyone. 1.15 pm What I have just shared is but a basic framework to continue to promote active ageing. To flesh it out, we must encourage, enable and embrace more ground-up initiatives. And the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Sam Tan, will later share an example of this in Mandarin. Sir, let us together, with and for our seniors, achieve what Mr Desmond Lee calls the \"silver summer\" of happy, healthy and active ageing. And by doing so, we will have taken yet another concrete step towards living long, living well and with peace of mind."
