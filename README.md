## Overview

This is a PQ (parliamentary question) analyzer. It lets you see the salient topics present within the corpus of PQs and draw relationships between topics and the MPs (members of parliaments) raising the questions. This information can then be used to infer each MP's areas of interest.

## Usage

Use my `pq-scraper` repo first to scrape the corpus. Then use this one. Requirements are in `requirements.txt`; use `pip` rather than `conda` and make sure your Python is on 3.7. Expect to have to try multiple times to resolve the dependencies; the versions are really quite weird.
